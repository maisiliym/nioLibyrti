# The State

## The State as Aggressor

Almost all persons and schools of thought oppose the exercise of random
violence against persons and property.

A “district attorney” prosecutes criminals in the name of a nonexistent
“society,” even against the wishes of the victim of crime. It is the victim who
must decide whether to press charges. Furthermore, the victim must be able to
press suit against a wrongdoer without having to convince the same district
attorney that he should proceed. The emphasis must never be on “society’s”
jailing the criminal; the emphasis must necessarily be on compelling the
criminal to make restitution to the victim of his crime. For the victim to pay
taxes to support the incarceration of his own attacker is evident nonsense.

There must be no governmental machinery that pursues and tries criminals even
against the wishes of the victim.

The State is the supreme, the eternal, the best organized aggressor against the
persons and property of the mass of the public. *All* States everywhere,
whether democratic, dictatorial, or monarchical, whether red, white, blue, or
turquoise.

Always and ever the government and its rulers and operators have been
considered above the general moral law.  Service to the State is supposed to
excuse all actions that would be considered immoral or criminal if committed by
“private” citizens.  The law must be uncompromisingly applied to people acting
in their roles as members of the State apparatus. For centuries, individuals
acting in their roles as “members of the government” have cloaked their
criminal activity in highsounding rhetoric. For centuries they have committed
mass murder and called it “war”; then ennobled the mass slaughter that “war”
involves. For centuries they have enslaved people into their armed battalions
and called it “conscription” in the “national service.” For centuries they have
robbed people at bayonet point and called it “taxation.”

No constitution can interpret or enforce itself; it must be interpreted by
*men*. And if the ultimate power to interpret a constitution is given to the
government’s own Supreme Court, then the inevitable tendency is for the Court
to continue to place its imprimatur on ever-broader powers for its own
government.

Even if 90 percent of the people decided to murder or enslave the other 10
percent, this would *still* be murder and slavery. Crime is crime, aggression
against rights is aggression, no matter how many citizens agree to the
oppression. There is nothing sacrosanct about the majority.

## The State and the Intellectuals

Since the early origins of the State, its rulers have always turned, as a
necessary bolster to their rule, to an alliance with society’s class of
intellectuals. The masses do not create their own abstract ideas, or indeed
think through these ideas independently; they follow passively the ideas
adopted and promulgated by the body of intellectuals, who become the effective
“opinion moulders” in society.  And since it is precisely a moulding of opinion
on behalf of the rulers that the State almost desperately needs, this forms a
firm basis for the alliance of the intellectuals and the ruling classes of the
State. The alliance is based on a *quid pro quo*: on the one hand, the
intellectuals spread among the masses the idea that the State and its rulers
are wise, good, sometimes divine, and at the very least inevitable and better
than any conceivable alternatives. In return for this panoply of ideology, the
State incorporates the intellectuals as part of the ruling elite, granting them
power, status, prestige, and material security.

Many and subtle are the ideological weapons the State and its intellectuals
have used over the centuries to induce their subjects to accept their rule. One
excellent weapon has been the power of *tradition*. Worship of one’s ancestors
then becomes a none-too-subtle means of cultivating worship of one’s ancestral
rulers. The force of tradition is, of course, bolstered by ancient *habit*,
which confirms the subjects in the seeming propriety and legitimacy of the rule
under which they live.

Another potent ideological force is for the State to deprecate the *individual*
and exalt either the past or the present collectivity of society. Any isolated
voice, any raiser of new doubts, can then be attacked as a profane violator of
the wisdom of his ancestors. Moreover, any new idea, much less any new
*critical* idea, must necessarily *begin* as a small minority opinion.
Therefore, in order to ward off any potentially dangerous idea from threatening
majority acceptance of its rule, the State will try to nip the new idea in the
bud by ridiculing any view that sets itself against mass opinion.

All that government can see in an original idea is potential change, and hence
an invasion of its prerogatives. The most dangerous man, to any government, is
the man who is able to think things out for himself, without regard to the
prevailing superstitions and taboos.  Almost inevitably he comes to the
conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane and
intolerable.

It is also particularly important for the State to make its rule seem
*inevitable*: even if its reign is disliked, as it often is, it will then be
met with passive resignation.

Each State has been particularly successful over the centuries in instilling
fear among its subjects of *other* State rulers. One of the basic doctrines of
the rulers of each State has been to identify *itself* with the territory it
governs. Since most men tend to love their homeland, the identification of that
land and its population with the State is a means of making natural patriotism
work to the State’s advantage. In this way, a war between *rulers* is converted
into a war between *peoples.*

The intellectual arguments used by the State throughout history to “engineer
consent” by the public can be classified into two parts: (1) that rule by the
existing government is inevitable; and (2) that the State rulers are especially
great, wise, and altruistic men. The increasing use of scientific jargon,
especially in the social sciences, has permitted intellectuals to weave
apologia for State rule which rival the ancient priestcraft in obscurantism.

The typical model of the origin of the State was not via a voluntary “social
contract” but by the conquest of one tribe by another. The original liberty of
the tribe or the peasantry thus falls victim to the conquerors.

But while throughout Western history, intellectuals have formulated
theories designed to check and *limit* State power, each State has been
able to use its own intellectuals to turn those ideas around into
further legitimations of its own advance of power. Thus, originally, in
Western Europe the concept of the “divine right of kings” was a doctrine
promoted by the Church to limit State power. The idea was that the king
could not just impose his arbitrary will. His edicts were limited to
conforming with the divine law. As absolute monarchy advanced, however,
the kings were able to turn the concept around to the idea that God put
his stamp of approval on any of the king’s actions; that he ruled by
“divine right.”

Similarly, the concept of parliamentary democracy began as a popular
check on the absolute rule of the monarch. The king was limited by the
power of parliament to grant him tax revenues. Gradually, however, as
parliament displaced the king as head of State, the parliament itself
became the unchecked State sovereign. In the early nineteenth century,
English utilitarians, who advocated additional individual liberty in the
name of social utility and the general welfare, were to see these
concepts turned into sanctions for expanding the power of the State.

Certainly, the most ambitious attempt in history to impose limits on the
State was the Bill of Rights and other restrictive parts of the United
States Constitution. Here, written limits on government became the
fundamental law, to be interpreted by a judiciary supposedly independent
of the other branches of government. All Americans are familiar with the
process by which John C. Calhoun’s prophetic analysis has been
vindicated; the State’s own monopoly judiciary has inexorably broadened
the construction of State power over the last century and a half. But
few have been as keen as liberal Professor Charles Black—who hails the
process—in seeing that the State has been able to transform judicial
review itself from a limiting device into a powerful instrument for
gaining legitimacy for its actions in the minds of the public. If a
judicial decree of “unconstitutional” is a mighty check on governmental
power, so too a verdict of “constitutional” is an equally mighty weapon
for fostering public acceptance of ever greater governmental power.

Professor Black begins his analysis by pointing out the crucial
necessity for “legitimacy” of any government in order to endure; that
is, basic majority acceptance of the government and its actions.
Acceptance of legitimacy, however, becomes a real problem in a country
like the United States, where “substantive limitations are built into
the theory on which the government rests.” What is needed, adds Black,
is a method by which the government can assure the public that its
expanding powers are indeed “constitutional.” And this, he concludes,
has been the major historic function of judicial review. Let Black
illustrate the problem:

This danger is averted, Black adds, by the State’s propounding the
doctrine that *some one* agency must have the ultimate decision on
constitutionality, and that this agency must be part of the federal
government itself. For while the seeming independence of the federal
judiciary has played a vital role in making its actions virtual Holy
Writ for the bulk of the population, it is also true that the judiciary
is part and parcel of the government apparatus and is appointed by the
executive and legislative branches. Professor Black concedes that the
government has thereby set itself up as a judge in its own case, and has
thus violated a basic juridical principle for arriving at any kind of
just decision. But Black is remarkably lighthearted about this
fundamental breach: “The final power of the State... must stop where the
law stops it. And who shall set the limit, and who shall enforce the
stopping, against the mightiest power? Why, the State itself, of course,
through its judges and its laws. Who controls the temperate? Who teaches
the wise?”^[21](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn21)^ And so Black admits that
when we have a State, we hand over all our weapons and means of coercion
to the State apparatus, we turn over all of our powers of ultimate
decision-making to this deified group, and *then* we must jolly well sit
back quietly and await the unending stream of justice that will pour
forth from these institutions—even though they are basically judging
their own case. Black sees no conceivable alternative to this coercive
monopoly of judicial decisions enforced by the State, but here is
precisely where our new movement challenges this conventional view and
asserts that there *is* a viable alternative: libertarianism.

Seeing no such alternative, Professor Black falls back on mysticism in
his defense of the State, for in the final analysis he finds the
achievement of justice and legitimacy from the State’s perpetual judging
of its own cause to be “something of a miracle.” In this way, the
liberal Black joins the conservative Burnham in falling back on the
miraculous and thereby admitting that there is no satisfactory rational
argument in support of the State.^[22](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn22)^

Applying his realistic view of the Supreme Court to the famous conflict
between the Court and the New Deal in the 1930s, Professor Black chides
his liberal colleagues for their shortsightedness in denouncing judicial
obstructionism:

> the standard version of the story of the New Deal and the Court,

> affirmative stamp of legitimacy on the New Deal, and on the whole new
> conception of government in America.* \[Italics the

In this way, the Supreme Court was able to put the quietus to the large
body of Americans who had strong constitutional objections to the
expanded powers of the New Deal:

> Deal.^[24](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn24)^

Thus, even in the United States, unique among governments in having a
constitution, parts of which at least were meant to impose strict and
solemn limits upon its actions, even here the Constitution has proved to
be an instrument for ratifying the expansion of State power rather than
the opposite. As Calhoun saw, any written limits that leave it to
government to interpret its own powers are bound to be interpreted as
sanctions for expanding and not binding those powers. In a profound
sense, the idea of binding down power with the chains of a written
constitution has proved to be a noble experiment that failed. The idea
of a strictly limited government has proved to be utopian; some other,
more radical means must be found to prevent the growth of the aggressive
State. The libertarian system would meet this problem by scrapping the
entire notion of creating a government—an institution with a coercive
monopoly of force over a given territory—and *then* hoping to find ways
to keep that government from expanding. The libertarian alternative is
to abstain from such a monopoly government to begin with.

We will explore the entire notion of a State-less society, a society
without formal government, in later chapters. But one instructive
exercise is to try to abandon the habitual ways of seeing things, and to
consider the argument for the State *de novo.* Let us try to transcend
the fact that for as long as we can remember, the State has monopolized
police and judicial services in society. Suppose that we were all
starting completely from scratch, and that millions of us had been
dropped down upon the earth, fully grown and developed, from some other
planet. Debate begins as to how protection (police and judicial
services) will be provided. Someone says: “Let’s all give all of our
weapons to Joe Jones over there, and to his relatives. And let Jones and
his family decide all disputes among us. In that way, the Joneses will
be able to protect all of us from any aggression or fraud that anyone
else may commit. With all the power and all the ability to make ultimate
decisions on disputes in the hands of Jones, we will all be protected
from one another. And then let us allow the Joneses to obtain their
income from this great service by using their weapons, and by exacting
as much revenue by coercion as they shall desire.” Surely in that sort
of situation, no one would treat this proposal with anything but
ridicule. For it would be starkly evident that there would be no way, in
that case, for any of us to protect ourselves from the aggressions, or
the depredations, of the Joneses themselves. No one would then have the
total folly to respond to that long-standing and most perceptive query:
“Who shall guard the guardians?” by answering with Professor Black’s
blithe: “Who controls the temperate?” It is only because we have become
accustomed over thousands of years to the existence of the State that we
now give precisely this kind of absurd answer to the problem of social
protection and defense.

And, of course, the State never really did begin with this sort of
“social contract.” As Oppenheimer pointed out, the State generally began
in violence and conquest; even if at times internal processes gave rise
to the State, it was certainly never by general consensus or contract.

The libertarian creed can now be summed up as (1) the absolute right of
every man to the ownership of his own body; (2) the equally absolute
right to own and therefore to control the material resources he has
found and transformed; and (3) therefore, the absolute right to exchange
or give away the ownership to such titles to whoever is willing to
exchange or receive them. As we have seen, each of these steps involves
*property* rights, but even if we call step (1) “personal” rights, we
shall see that problems about “personal liberty” inextricably involve
the rights of material property or free exchange. Or, briefly, the
rights of personal liberty and “freedom of enterprise” almost invariably
intertwine and cannot really be separated.

We have seen that the exercise of personal “freedom of speech,” for
example, almost invariably involves the exercise of “economic
freedom”—i.e., freedom to own and exchange material property. The
holding of a meeting to exercise freedom of speech involves the hiring
of a hall, traveling to the hall over roads, and using some form of
transportation, etc. The closely related “freedom of the press” even
more evidently involves the cost of printing and of using a press, the
sale of leaflets to willing buyers—in short, all the ingredients of
“economic freedom.” Furthermore, our example of “shouting ‘fire’ in a
crowded theater” provides us with the clear guideline for deciding
*whose* rights must be defended in any given situation—the guidelines
being provided by our criterion: the rights of property.
