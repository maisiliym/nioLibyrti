## The Nonaggression Axiom

No man or group of men may aggress against the person or property of anyone
else. This may be called the “nonaggression axiom.” “Aggression” is defined as
the initiation of the use or threat of physical violence against the person or
property of anyone else

If no man may aggress against another; if, in short, everyone has the
absolute right to be “free” from aggression, then this at once implies the
freedom to speak, publish, assemble, and to engage in such “victimless
crimes” as pornography, sexual deviation, and prostitution. Furthermore,
conscription is slavery on a massive scale. And since war, especially
modern war, entails the mass slaughter of civilians, it is mass murder and
therefore totally illegitimate.

If every individual has the right to his own property without having to
suffer aggressive depredation, then he also has the right to give away his
property (bequest and inheritance) and to exchange it for the property of
others (free contract and the free market economy) without interference.

While opposing any and all private or group aggression against the
rights of person and property, the libertarian sees that throughout
history and into the present day, there has been one central, dominant,
and overriding aggressor upon all of these rights: the State. In
contrast to all other thinkers, left, right, or in-between, the
libertarian refuses to give the State the moral sanction to commit
actions that almost everyone agrees would be immoral, illegal, and
criminal if committed by any person or group in society. The
libertarian, in short, insists on applying the general moral law to
everyone, and makes no special exemptions for any person or group. But
if we look at the State naked, as it were, we see that it is universally
allowed, and even encouraged, to commit all the acts which even
non-libertarians concede are reprehensible crimes. The State habitually
commits mass murder, which it calls “war,” or sometimes “suppression of
subversion”; the State engages in enslavement into its military forces,
which it calls “conscription”; and it lives and has its being in the
practice of forcible theft, which it calls “taxation.” The libertarian
insists that whether or not such practices are supported by the majority
of the population is not germane to their nature: that, regardless of
popular sanction, War is Mass Murder, Conscription is Slavery, and
Taxation is Robbery. The libertarian, in short, is almost completely the
child in the fable, pointing out insistently that the emperor has no
clothes.

Throughout the ages, the emperor has had a series of pseudo-clothes
provided for him by the nation’s intellectual caste. In past centuries,
the intellectuals informed the public that the State or its rulers were
divine, or at least clothed in divine authority, and therefore what
might *look* to the naive and untutored eye as despotism, mass murder,
and theft on a grand scale was only the divine working its benign and
mysterious ways in the body politic. In recent decades, as the divine
sanction has worn a bit threadbare, the emperor’s “court intellectuals”
have spun ever more sophisticated apologia: informing the public that
what the government does is for the “common good” and the “public
welfare,” that the process of taxation-and-spending works through the
mysterious process of the “multiplier” to keep the economy on an even
keel, and that, in any case, a wide variety of governmental “services”
could not possibly be performed by citizens acting voluntarily on the
market or in society. All of this the libertarian denies: he sees the
various apologia as fraudulent means of obtaining public support for the
State’s rule, and he insists that whatever services the government
actually performs could be supplied far more efficiently and far more
morally by private and cooperative enterprise.

The libertarian therefore considers one of his prime educational tasks
is to spread the demystification and desanctification of the State among
its hapless subjects. His task is to demonstrate repeatedly and in depth
that not only the emperor but even the “democratic” State has no
clothes; that all governments subsist by exploitive rule over the
public; and that such rule is the reverse of objective necessity. He
strives to show that the very existence of taxation and the State
necessarily sets up a class division between the exploiting rulers and
the exploited ruled. He seeks to show that the task of the court
intellectuals who have always supported the State has ever been to weave
mystification in order to induce the public to accept State rule, and
that these intellectuals obtain, in return, a share in the power and
pelf extracted by the rulers from their deluded subjects.

Take, for example, the institution of taxation, which statists have
claimed is in some sense really “voluntary.” Anyone who truly believes
in the “voluntary” nature of taxation is invited to refuse to pay taxes
and to see what then happens to him. If we analyze taxation, we find
that, among all the persons and institutions in society, only the
government acquires its revenues through coercive violence. Everyone
else in society acquires income *either* through voluntary gift (lodge,
charitable society, chess club) *or* through the sale of goods or
services voluntarily purchased by consumers. If anyone *but* the
government proceeded to “tax,” this would clearly be considered coercion
and thinly disguised banditry. Yet the mystical trappings of
“sovereignty” have so veiled the process that only libertarians are
prepared to call taxation what it is: legalized and organized theft on a
grand scale.

## PROPERTY RIGHTS [property-rights]

If the central axiom of the libertarian creed is nonaggression against
anyone’s person and property, how is this axiom arrived at? What is its
groundwork or support? Here, libertarians, past and present, have
differed considerably. Roughly, there are three broad types of
foundation for the libertarian axiom, corresponding to three kinds of
ethical philosophy: the emotivist, the utilitarian, and the natural
rights viewpoint. The emotivists assert that they take liberty or
nonaggression as their premise purely on subjective, emotional grounds.
While their own intense emotion might seem a valid basis for their own
political philosophy, this can scarcely serve to convince anyone else.
By ultimately taking themselves outside the realm of rational discourse,
the emotivists thereby insure the lack of general success of their own
cherished doctrine.

The utilitarians declare, from their study of the consequences of
liberty as opposed to alternative systems, that liberty will lead more
surely to widely approved goals: harmony, peace, prosperity, etc. Now no
one disputes that relative consequences should be studied in assessing
the merits or demerits of respective creeds. But there are many problems
in confining ourselves to a utilitarian ethic. For one thing,
utilitarianism assumes that we can weigh alternatives, and decide upon
policies, on the basis of their good or bad *consequences*. But if it is
legitimate to apply value judgments to the *consequences* of X, why is
it not equally legitimate to apply such judgments to X *itself*? May
there not be something about an act itself which, in its very nature,
can be considered good or evil?

Another problem with the utilitarian is that he will rarely adopt a
principle as an absolute and consistent yardstick to apply to the varied
concrete situations of the real world. He will only use a principle, at
best, as a vague guideline or aspiration, as a *tendency* which he may
choose to override at any time. This was the major defect of the
nineteenth-century English Radicals, who had adopted the laissez-faire
view of the eighteenth-century liberals but had substituted a supposedly
“scientific” utilitarianism for the supposedly “mystical” concept of
natural rights as the groundwork for that philosophy. Hence the
nineteenth-century laissez-faire liberals came to use laissez-faire as a
vague tendency rather than as an unblemished yardstick, and therefore
increasingly and fatally compromised the libertarian creed. To say that
a utilitarian cannot be “trusted” to maintain libertarian principle in
every specific application may sound harsh, but it puts the case fairly.
A notable contemporary example is the free-market economist Professor
Milton Friedman who, like his classical economist forebears, holds to
freedom as against State intervention as a general tendency, but in
practice allows a myriad of damaging exceptions, exceptions which serve
to vitiate the principle almost completely, notably in the fields of
police and military affairs, education, taxation, welfare, “neighborhood
effects,” antitrust laws, and money and banking.

Let us consider a stark example: Suppose a society which fervently
considers all redheads to be agents of the Devil and therefore to be
executed whenever found. Let us further assume that only a small number
of redheads exist in any generation—so few as to be statistically
insignificant. The utilitarian-libertarian might well reason: “While the
murder of isolated redheads is deplorable, the executions are small in
number; the vast majority of the public, as non-redheads, achieves
enormous psychic satisfaction from the public execution of redheads. The
social cost is negligible, the social, psychic benefit to the rest of
society is great; therefore, it is right and proper for society to
execute the redheads.” The natural-rights libertarian, overwhelmingly
concerned as he is for the *justice* of the act, will react in horror
and staunchly and unequivocally oppose the executions as totally
unjustified murder and aggression upon nonaggressive persons. The
*consequence* of stopping the murders—depriving the bulk of society of
great psychic pleasure—would not influence such a libertarian, the
“absolutist” libertarian, in the slightest. Dedicated to justice and to
logical consistency, the natural-rights libertarian cheerfully admits to
being “doctrinaire,” to being, in short, an unabashed follower of his
own doctrines.

Let us turn then to the natural-rights basis for the libertarian creed,
a basis which, in one form or another, has been adopted by most of the
libertarians, past and present. “Natural rights” is the cornerstone of a
political philosophy which, in turn, is embedded in a greater structure
of “natural law.” Natural law theory rests on the insight that we live
in a world of more than one—in fact, a vast number—of entities, and that
each entity has distinct and specific properties, a distinct “nature,”
which can be investigated by man’s reason, by his sense perception and
mental faculties. Copper has a distinct nature and behaves in a certain
way, and so do iron, salt, etc. The species man, therefore, has a
specifiable nature, as does the world around him and the ways of
interaction between them. To put it with undue brevity, the activity of
each inorganic and organic entity is determined by its own nature and by
the nature of the other entities with which it comes in contact.
Specifically, while the behavior of plants and at least the lower
animals is determined by their biological nature or perhaps by their
“instincts,” the nature of man is such that each individual person must,
in order to act, choose his own ends and employ his own means in order
to attain them. Possessing no automatic instincts, each man must learn
about himself and the world, use his mind to select values, learn about
cause and effect, and act purposively to maintain himself and advance
his life. Since men can think, feel, evaluate, and act only as
individuals, it becomes vitally necessary for each man’s survival and
prosperity that he be free to learn, choose, develop his faculties, and
act upon his knowledge and values. This is the necessary path of human
nature; to interfere with and cripple this process by using violence
goes profoundly against what is necessary by man’s nature for his life
and prosperity. Violent interference with a man’s learning and choices
is therefore profoundly “antihuman”; it violates the natural law of
man’s needs.

Individualists have always been accused by their enemies of being
“atomistic”—of postulating that each individual lives in a kind of
vacuum, thinking and choosing without relation to anyone else in
society. This, however, is an authoritarian straw man; few, if any,
individualists have ever been “atomists.” On the contrary, it is evident
that individuals always learn from each other, cooperate and interact
with each other; and that this, too, is required for man’s survival. But
the point is that each individual makes the final choice of which
influences to adopt and which to reject, or of which to adopt first and
which afterwards. The libertarian welcomes the process of voluntary
exchange and cooperation between freely acting individuals; what he
abhors is the use of violence to cripple such voluntary cooperation and
force someone to choose and act in ways different from what his own mind
dictates.

The most viable method of elaborating the natural-rights statement of
the libertarian position is to divide it into parts, and to begin with
the basic axiom of the “right to self-ownership.” The right to
self-ownership asserts the absolute right of each man, by virtue of his
(or her) being a human being, to “own” his or her own body; that is, to
control that body free of coercive interference. Since each individual
must think, learn, value, and choose his or her ends and means in order
to survive and flourish, the right to self-ownership gives man the right
to perform these vital activities without being hampered and restricted
by coercive molestation.

Consider, too, the consequences of *denying* each man the right to own
his own person. There are then only two alternatives: either (1) a
certain class of people, *A*, have the right to own another class, *B*;
or (2) everyone has the right to own his own equal quotal share of
everyone else. The first alternative implies that while Class *A*
deserves the rights of being human, Class *B* is in reality subhuman and
therefore deserves no such rights. But since they *are* indeed human
beings, the first alternative contradicts itself in denying natural
human rights to one set of humans. Moreover, as we shall see, allowing
Class *A* to own Class *B* means that the former is allowed to exploit,
and therefore to live parasitically, at *the expense* of the latter. But
this parasitism itself violates the basic economic requirement for life:
production and exchange.

The second alternative, what we might call “participatory communalism”
or “communism,” holds that every man should have the right to own his
equal quotal share of everyone else. If there are two billion people in
the world, then everyone has the right to own one two-billionth of every
other person. In the first place, we can state that this ideal rests on
an absurdity: proclaiming that every man is entitled to own a part of
everyone else, yet is not entitled *to own himself*. Secondly, we can
picture the viability of such a world: a world in which *no* man is free
to take *any* action whatever without prior approval or indeed command
by *everyone* else in society. It should be clear that in that sort of
“communist” world, no one would be able to do anything, and the human
race would quickly perish. But if a world of zero self-ownership and one
hundred percent other ownership spells death for the human race, then
any steps in that direction also contravene the natural law of what is
best for man and his life on earth.

Finally, however, the participatory communist world *cannot* be put into
practice. For it is physically impossible for everyone to keep continual
tabs on everyone else, and thereby to exercise his equal quotal share of
partial ownership over every other man. In practice, then, the concept
of universal and equal other-ownership is utopian and impossible, and
supervision and therefore control and ownership of others necessarily
devolves upon a specialized group of people, who thereby become a ruling
class. Hence, in practice, any attempt at communist rule will
automatically become class rule, and we would be back at our first
alternative.

The libertarian therefore rejects these alternatives and concludes by
adopting as his primary axiom the universal right of self-ownership, a
right held by everyone by virtue of being a human being. A more
difficult task is to settle on a theory of property in nonhuman objects,
in the things of this earth. It is comparatively easy to recognize the
practice when someone is aggressing against the property right of
another’s person: If *A* assaults *B*, he is violating the property
right of *B* in his own body. But with nonhuman objects the problem is
more complex. If, for example, we see *X* seizing a watch in the
possession of *Y* we cannot automatically assume that *X* is aggressing
against *Y*’s right of property in the watch; for may not *X* have been
the original, “true” owner of the watch who can therefore be said to be
repossessing his own legitimate property? In order to decide, we need a
theory of justice in property, a theory that will tell us whether *X* or
*Y* or indeed someone else is the legitimate owner.

Some libertarians attempt to resolve the problem by asserting that
whoever the existing government decrees has the property title should be
considered the just owner of the property. At this point, we have not
yet delved deeply into the nature of government, but the anomaly here
should be glaring enough: it is surely odd to find a group eternally
suspicious of virtually any and all functions of government suddenly
leaving it to government to define and apply the precious concept of
property, the base and groundwork of the entire social order. It is
particularly the utilitarian laissez-fairists who believe it most
feasible to begin the new libertarian world by confirming all existing
property titles; that is, property titles and rights as decreed by the
very government that is condemned as a chronic aggressor.

Let us illustrate with a hypothetical example. Suppose that libertarian
agitation and pressure has escalated to such a point that the government
and its various branches are ready to abdicate. But they engineer a
cunning ruse. Just before the government of New York state abdicates it
passes a law turning over the entire territorial area of New York to
become the private property of the Rockefeller family. The Massachusetts
legislature does the same for the Kennedy family. And so on for each
state. The government could then abdicate and decree the abolition of
taxes and coercive legislation, but the victorious libertarians would
now be confronted with a dilemma. Do they recognize the new property
titles as legitimately private property? The utilitarians, who have no
theory of justice in property rights, would, if they were consistent
with their acceptance of given property titles as decreed by government,
have to accept a new social order in which fifty new satraps would be
collecting taxes in the form of unilaterally imposed “rent.” The point
is that *only* natural-rights libertarians, only those libertarians who
have a theory of justice in property titles that does not depend on
government decree, could be in a position to scoff at the new rulers’
claims to have private property in the territory of the country, and to
rebuff these claims as invalid. As the great nineteenth-century liberal
Lord Acton saw clearly, the natural law provides the only sure ground
for a continuing critique of governmental laws and
decrees.^[1](#24-notes.html#chap02_fn1)^ What, specifically, the
natural-rights position on property titles may be is the question to
which we now turn.

We have established each individual’s right to self-ownership, to a
property right in his own body and person. But people are not floating
wraiths; they are not self-subsistent entities; they can only survive
and flourish by grappling with the earth around them. They must, for
example, *stand* on land areas; they must also, in order to survive and
maintain themselves, transform the resources given by nature into
“consumer goods,” into objects more suitable for their use and
consumption. Food must be grown and eaten; minerals must be mined and
then transformed into capital and then useful consumer goods, etc. Man,
in other words, must own not only his own person, but also material
objects for his control and use. How, then, should the property titles
in these objects be allocated?

Let us take, as our first example, a sculptor fashioning a work of art
out of clay and other materials; and let us waive, for the moment, the
question of original property rights in the clay and the sculptor’s
tools. The question then becomes: *Who* owns the work of art as it
emerges from the sculptor’s fashioning? It is, in fact, the sculptor’s
“creation,” not in the sense that he has created matter, but in the
sense that he has transformed nature-given matter—the clay—into another
form dictated by his own ideas and fashioned by his own hands and
energy. Surely, it is a rare person who, with the case put thus, would
say that the sculptor does not have the property right in his own
product. Surely, if every man has the right to own his own body, and if
he must grapple with the material objects of the world in order to
survive, then the sculptor has the right to own the product he has made,
by his energy and effort, a veritable *extension* of his own
personality. He has placed the stamp of his person upon the raw
material, by “mixing his labor” with the clay, in the phrase of the
great property theorist John Locke. And the product transformed by his
own energy has become the material embodiment of the sculptor’s ideas
and vision. John Locke put the case this way:

> ... every man has a *property* in his own *person*. This nobody has
> any right to but himself. The *labour* of his body and the *work* of
> his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever, then, he removes
> out of the state that nature hath provided and left it in, he hath
> mixed his labour with it, and joined it to something that is his own,
> and thereby makes it his property. It being by him removed from the
> common state nature placed it in, it hath by this labour something
> annexed to it that excludes the common right of other men. For this
> labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but
> he can have a right to what that is once joined
> to.^[2](#24-notes.html#chap02_fn2)^

As in the case of the ownership of people’s bodies, we again have three
logical alternatives: (1) either the transformer, or “creator” has the
property right in his creation; or (2) another man or set of men have
the right in that creation, i.e., have the right to appropriate it by
force without the sculptor’s consent; or (3) every individual in the
world has an equal, quotal share in the ownership of the sculpture—the
“communal” solution. Again, put baldly, there are very few who would not
concede the monstrous injustice of confiscating the sculptor’s property,
either by one or more others, or on behalf of the world as a whole. By
what right do they do so? By what right do they appropriate to
themselves the product of the creator’s mind and energy? In this
clear-cut case, the right of the creator to own what he has mixed his
person and labor with would be generally conceded. (Once again, as in
the case of communal ownership of persons, the world communal solution
would, in practice, be reduced to an oligarchy of a *few* others
expropriating the creator’s work *in the name of* “world public”
ownership.)

The main point, however, is that the case of the sculptor is not
qualitatively different from *all* cases of “production.” The man or men
who had extracted the clay from the ground and had sold it to the
sculptor may not be as “creative” as the sculptor, but they too are
“producers,” they too have mixed their ideas and their technological
know-how with the nature-given soil to emerge with a useful product.
They, too, are “producers,” and they too have mixed their labor with
natural materials to transform those materials into more useful goods
and services. These persons, too, are entitled to the ownership of their
products. Where then does the process begin? Again, let us turn to
Locke:

> He that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak, or the
> apples he gathered from the trees in the wood, has certainly
> appropriated them to himself. Nobody can deny but the nourishment is
> his. I ask then, when did they begin to be his? When he digested? or

If every man owns his own person and therefore his own labor, and if by
extension he owns whatever property he has “created” or gathered out of
the previously unused, unowned, “state of nature,” then what of the last
great question: the right to own or control the earth *itself*? In
short, if the gatherer has the right to own the acorns or berries he
picks, or the farmer the right to own his crop of wheat or peaches,
*who* has the right to own the land on which these things have grown? It
is at this point that Henry George and his followers, who have gone all
the way so far with the libertarians, leave the track and deny the
individual’s right to own the piece of land itself, the *ground* on
which these activities have taken place. The Georgists argue that, while
every man should own the goods which he produces or creates, since
Nature or God created the land itself, no individual has the right to
assume ownership of that land. Yet, if the land is to be used at all as
a resource in any sort of efficient manner, it must be owned or
controlled by *someone* or some group, and we are again faced with our
three alternatives: either the land belongs to the first user, the man
who first brings it into production; *or* it belongs to a group of
others; *or* it belongs to the world as a whole, with every individual
owning a quotal part of every acre of land. George’s option for the last
solution hardly solves his moral problem: If the land itself should
belong to God or Nature, then why as it more moral for every acre in the
world to be owned by the world as a whole, than to concede individual
ownership? In practice, again, it is obviously impossible for every
person in the world to exercise effective ownership of his
four-billionth portion (if the world population is, say, four billion)
of every piece of the world’s land surface. In practice, of course, a
small oligarchy would do the controlling and owning, and not the world
as a whole.

But apart from these difficulties in the Georgist position, the
natural-rights justification for the ownership of ground land is the
same as the justification for the original ownership of all other
property. For, as we have seen, no producer *really* “creates” matter;
he takes nature-given matter and transforms it by his labor energy in
accordance with his ideas and vision. But *this* is precisely what the
pioneer—the “homesteader”—does when he brings previously unused land
into his own private ownership. Just as the man who makes steel out of
iron ore transforms that ore out of his know-how and with his energy,
and just as the man who takes the iron out of the ground does the same,
so does the homesteader who clears, fences, cultivates, or builds upon
the land. The homesteader, too, has transformed the character of the
nature-given soil by his labor and his personality. The homesteader is
just as legitimately the owner of the property as the sculptor or the
manufacturer; he is just as much a “producer” as the others.

Furthermore, if the original land is nature- or God-given then so are
the people’s talents, health, and beauty. And just as all these
attributes are given to specific individuals and not to “society,” so
then are land and natural resources. All of these resources are given to
individuals and not to “society,” which is an abstraction that does not
actually exist. There is no existing entity called “society”; there are
only interacting individuals. To say that “society” should own land or
any other property in common, then, must mean that a group of
oligarchs—in practice, government bureaucrats—should own the property,
and at the expense of expropriating the creator or the homesteader who
had originally brought this product into existence.

Moreover, no one can produce *anything* without the cooperation of
original land, if only as standing room. No man can produce or create
anything by his labor alone; he must have the cooperation of land and
other natural raw materials.

Man comes into the world with just himself and the world around him—the
land and natural resources given him by nature. He takes these resources
and transforms them by his labor and mind and energy into goods more
useful to man. Therefore, if an individual cannot own original land,
neither can he in the full sense own any of the fruits of his labor. The
farmer cannot own his wheat crop if he cannot own the land on which the
wheat grows. Now that his labor has been inextricably mixed with the
land, he cannot be deprived of one without being deprived of the other.

Moreover, if a producer is *not* entitled to the fruits of his labor,
who is? It is difficult to see why a newborn Pakistani baby should have
a moral claim to a quotal share of ownership of a piece of Iowa land
that someone has just transformed into a wheatfield—and vice versa of
course for an Iowan baby and a Pakistani farm. Land in its original
state is unused and unowned. Georgists and other land communalists may
claim that the whole world population really “owns” it, but if no one
has yet used it, it is in the real sense owned and controlled by no one.
The pioneer, the homesteader, the first user and transformer of this
land, is the man who first brings this simple valueless thing into
production and social use. It is difficult to see the morality of
depriving him of ownership in favor of people who have never gotten
within a thousand miles of the land, and who may not even know of the
existence of the property over which they are supposed to have a claim.

The moral, natural-rights issue involved here is even clearer if we
consider the case of animals. Animals are “economic land,” since they
are original nature-given resources. Yet will anyone deny full title to
a horse to the man who finds and domesticates it—is this any different
from the acorns and berries that are generally conceded to the gatherer?
Yet in land, too, some homesteader takes the previously “wild,”
undomesticated land, and “tames” it by putting it to productive use.
Mixing his labor with land sites should give him just as clear a title
as in the case of animals. As Locke declared: “As much land as a man
tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much
is his property. He by his labour does, as it were, enclose it from the
common.”^[4](#24-notes.html#chap02_fn4)^

The libertarian theory of property was eloquently summed up by two
nineteenth-century laissez-faire French economists:

> If man acquires rights over things, it is because he is at once
> active, intelligent and free; by his activity he spreads over external
> nature; by his intelligence he governs it, and bends it to his use; by
> his liberty, he establishes between himself and it the relation of

> Where is there, in a civilized country, a clod of earth, a leaf, which
> does not bear this impress of the personality of man? In the town, we
> are surrounded by the works of man; we walk upon a level pavement or a
> beaten road; it is man who made healthy the formerly muddy soil, who

## SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL [society-and-the-individual]

We have talked at length of individual rights; but what, it may be
asked, of the “rights of society”? Don’t they supersede the rights of
the mere individual? The libertarian, however, is an individualist; he
believes that one of the prime errors in social theory is to treat
“society” as if it were an actually existing entity. “Society” is
sometimes treated as a superior or quasi-divine figure with overriding
“rights” of its own; at other times as an existing evil which can be
blamed for all the ills of the world. The individualist holds that only
individuals exist, think, feel, choose, and act; and that “society” is
not a living entity but simply a label for a set of interacting
individuals. Treating society as a thing that chooses and acts, then,
serves to obscure the real forces at work. If, in a small community, ten
people band together to rob and expropriate three others then this is
clearly and evidently a case of a group of individuals acting in concert
against another group. In this situation, if the ten people presumed to
refer to themselves as “society” acting in “its” interest, the rationale
would be laughed out of court; even the ten robbers would probably be
too shamefaced to use this sort of argument. But let their size
increase, and this kind of obfuscation becomes rife and succeeds in
duping the public.

The fallacious use of a collective noun like “nation,” similar in this
respect to “society,” has been trenchantly pointed out by the historian
Parker T. Moon:

> When one uses the simple monosyllable “France” one thinks of France as
> a unit, an entity. When... we say “France sent *her* troops to conquer
> Tunis”—we impute not only unit but personality to the country. The
> very words conceal the facts and make international relations a
> glamorous drama in which personalized nations are the actors, and all
> too easily we forget the flesh-and-blood men and women who are the
> true actors... if we had no such word as “France” ... then we should
> more accurately describe the Tunis expedition in some such way as
> this: “A few of these thirty-eight million persons sent thirty
> thousand others to conquer Tunis.” This way of putting the fact
> immediately suggests a question, or rather a series of questions. Who
> were the “few”? Why did they send the thirty thousand to Tunis? And
> why did these obey? Empire-building is done not by “nations,” but by
> men. The problem before us is to discover the men, the active,
> interested minorities in each nation, who are directly interested in
> imperialism and then to analyze the reasons why the majorities pay the
> expense and fight the war necessitated by imperialist
> expansion.^[6](#24-notes.html#chap02_fn6)^

The individualist view of “society” has been summed up in the phrase:
*“Society” is everyone but yourself.* Put thus bluntly, this analysis
can be used to consider those cases where “society” is treated, not only
as a superhero with superrights, but as a supervillain on whose
shoulders massive blame is placed. Consider the typical view that not
the individual criminal, but “society,” is responsible for his crime.
Take, for example, the case where Smith robs or murders Jones. The
“old-fashioned” view is that Smith is responsible for his act. The
modern liberal counters that “society” is responsible. This sounds both
sophisticated and humanitarian, until we apply the individualist
perspective. Then we see that what liberals are *really* saying is that
*everyone but* Smith, including of course the victim Jones, is
responsible for the crime. Put this baldly, almost everyone would
recognize the absurdity of this position. But conjuring up the fictive
entity “society” obfuscates this process. As the sociologist Arnold W.
Green puts it: “It would follow, then, that if society is responsible
for crime, and criminals are not responsible for crime, only those
members of society who do not commit crime can be held responsible for
crime. Nonsense this obvious can be circumvented only by conjuring up
society as devil, as evil being apart from people and what they
do.”^[7](#24-notes.html#chap02_fn7)^

The great American libertarian writer Frank Chodorov stressed this view
of society when he wrote that “Society Are People.”

> Society is a collective concept and nothing else; it is a convenience
> for designating a number of people. So, too, is family or crowd or
> gang, or any other name we give to an agglomeration of persons.
> Society... is not an extra “person”; if the census totals a hundred
> million, that’s all there are, not one more, for there cannot be any
> accretion to Society except by procreation. The concept of Society as
> a metaphysical person falls flat when we observe that Society
> disappears when the component parts disperse; as in the case of a
> “ghost town” or of a civilization we learn about by the artifacts they
> left behind. When the individuals disappear so does the whole. The
> whole has no separate existence. Using the collective noun with a
> singular verb leads us into a trap of the imagination; we are prone to
> personalize the collectivity and to think of it as having a body and a
> psyche of its own.^[8](#24-notes.html#chap02_fn8)^

## FREE EXCHANGE AND FREE CONTRACT [free-exchange-and-free-contract]

The central core of the libertarian creed, then, is to establish the
absolute right to private property of every man: first, in his own body,
and second, in the previously unused natural resources which he first
transforms by his labor. These two axioms, the right of self-ownership
and the right to “homestead,” establish the complete set of principles
of the libertarian system. The entire libertarian doctrine then becomes
the spinning out and the application of all the implications of this
central doctrine. For example, a man, *X*, owns his own person and labor
and the farm he clears on which he grows wheat. Another man, *Y*, owns
the fish he catches; a third man, *Z*, owns the cabbages he has grown
and the land under it. But if a man owns anything, he then has the right
to *give away* or *exchange* these property titles to someone else,
after which point the other person also has absolute property title.
From this corollary right to private property stems the basic
justification for free contract and for the free-market economy. Thus,
if *X* grows wheat, he may and probably will agree to exchange some of
that wheat for some of the fish caught by *Y* or for some of the
cabbages grown by *Z*. With both *X* and *Y* making voluntary agreements
to exchange property titles (or *Y* and *Z*, or *X* and *Z*) the
property then becomes with equal legitimacy the property of the other
person. If *X* exchanges wheat for *Y*’s fish, then that fish becomes
*X*’s property to do with as he wishes, and the wheat becomes *Y*’s
property in precisely the same way.

Further, a man may exchange not only the tangible objects he owns but
also his own labor, which of course he owns as well. Thus, *Z* may sell
his labor services of teaching farmer *X*’s children in return for some
of the farmer’s produce.

It so happens that the free-market economy, and the specialization and
division of labor it implies, is by far the most productive form of
economy known to man, and has been responsible for industrialization and
for the modern economy on which civilization has been built. This is a
fortunate utilitarian result of the free market, but it is not, to the
libertarian, the *prime* reason for his support of this system. That
prime reason is moral and is rooted in the natural-rights defense of
private property we have developed above. Even if a society of despotism
and systematic invasion of rights could be shown to be more productive
than what Adam Smith called “the system of natural liberty,” the
libertarian would support this system. Fortunately, as in so many other
areas, the utilitarian and the moral, natural rights and general
prosperity, go hand in hand.

The developed-market economy, as complex as the system appears to be on
the surface, is nothing more than a vast network of voluntary and
mutually agreed-upon two-person exchanges such as we have shown to occur
between wheat and cabbage farmers, or between the farmer and the
teacher. Thus, when I buy a newspaper for a dime, a mutually beneficial
two-person exchange takes place: I transfer my ownership of the dime to
the newsdealer and he transfers ownership of the paper to me. We do this
because, under the division of labor, I calculate that the paper is
worth more to me than the dime, while the newsdealer prefers the dime to
keeping the paper. Or, when I teach at a university, I estimate that I
prefer my salary to not expending my labor of teaching, while the
university authorities calculate that they prefer gaining my teaching
services to not paying me the money. If the newsdealer insisted on
charging 50¢ for the paper, I might well decide that it isn’t worth the
price; similarly, if I should insist on triple my present salary, the
university might well decide to dispense with my services.

Many people are willing to concede the justice and propriety of property
rights and the free-market economy, to concede that the farmer should be
able to charge whatever his wheat will bring from consumers or the
worker to reap whatever others are willing to pay for his services. But
they balk at one point: inheritance. If Willie Stargell is ten times as
good and “productive” a ball player as Joe Jack, they are willing to
concede the justice of Stargell’s earning ten times the amount; but
what, they ask, is the justification for someone whose only merit is
being born a Rockefeller inheriting far more wealth than someone born a
Rothbard? The libertarian answer is to concentrate *not* on the
recipient, the child Rockefeller or the child Rothbard, but to
concentrate on the *giver*, the man who bestows the inheritance. For if
Smith and Jones and Stargell have the right to their labor and property
and to exchange the titles to this property for the similar property of
others, they also have the right to *give* their property to whomever
they wish. And of course most such gifts consist of the gifts of the
property owners to their children—in short, inheritance. If Willie
Stargell owns his labor and the money he earns from it, then he has the
right to give that money to the baby Stargell.

In the developed free-market economy, then, the farmer exchanges the
wheat for money; the wheat is bought by the miller who processes and
transforms the wheat into flour; the miller sells the flour to the baker
who produces bread; the baker sells the bread to the wholesaler, who in
turn sells it to the retailer, who finally sells it to the consumer. And
at each step of the way, the producer may hire the labor services of the
workers in exchange for money. How “money” enters the equation is a
complex process; but it should be clear that *conceptually* the use of
money is equivalent to any single or group of useful commodities that
are exchanged for the wheat, flour, etc. Instead of money, the commodity
exchanged could be cloth, iron, or whatever. At each step of the way,
mutually beneficial exchanges of property titles are agreed upon and
transacted.

We are now in a position to see how the libertarian defines the concept
of “freedom” or “liberty.” Freedom is a condition in which a person’s
ownership rights in his own body and his legitimate material property
are *not* invaded, are not aggressed against. A man who steals another
man’s property is invading and restricting the victim’s freedom, as does
the man who beats another over the head. Freedom and unrestricted
property right go hand in hand. On the other hand, to the libertarian,
“crime” is an act of aggression against a man’s property right, either
in his own person or his materially owned objects. Crime is an invasion,
by the use of violence, against a man’s property and therefore against
his liberty. “Slavery”—the opposite of freedom—is a condition in which
the slave has little or no right of self-ownership; his person and his
produce are systematically expropriated by his master by the use of
violence.

The libertarian, then, is clearly an individualist but *not* an
egalitarian. The only “equality” he would advocate is the equal right of
every man to the property in his own person, to the property in the
unused resources he “homesteads,” and to the property of others he has
acquired either through voluntary exchange or gift.

## PROPERTY RIGHTS AND “HUMAN RIGHTS” [property-rights-and-human-rights]

Liberals will generally concede the right of every individual to his
“personal liberty,” to his freedom to think, speak, write, and engage in
such personal “exchanges” as sexual activity between “consenting
adults.” In short, the liberal attempts to uphold the individual’s right
to the ownership of his own body, but then denies his right to
“property,” i.e., to the ownership of material objects. Hence, the
typical liberal dichotomy between “human rights,” which he upholds, and
“property rights,” which he rejects. Yet the two, according to the
libertarian, are inextricably intertwined; they stand or fall together.

Take, for example, the liberal socialist who advocates government
ownership of all the “means of production” while upholding the “human”
right of freedom of speech or press. How is this “human” right to be
exercised if the individuals constituting the public are denied their
right to ownership of property? If, for example, the government owns all
the newsprint and all the printing shops, how is the right to a free
press to be exercised? If the government owns all the newsprint, it then
necessarily has the right and the power to allocate that newsprint, and
someone’s “right to a free press” becomes a mockery if the government
decides not to allocate newsprint in his direction. And since the
government must allocate scarce newsprint in *some* way, the right to a
free press of, say, minorities or “subversive” antisocialists will get
short shrift indeed. The same is true for the “right to free speech” if
the government owns all the assembly halls, and therefore allocates
those halls as it sees fit. Or, for example, if the government of Soviet
Russia, being atheistic, decides not to allocate many scarce resources
to the production of matzohs, for Orthodox Jews the “freedom of
religion” becomes a mockery; but again, the Soviet government can always
rebut that Orthodox Jews are a small minority and that capital equipment
should not be diverted to matzoh production.

The basic flaw in the liberal separation of “human rights” and “property
rights” is that people are treated as ethereal abstractions. If a man
has the right to self-ownership, to the control of his life, then in the
real world he must also have the right to sustain his life by grappling
with and transforming resources; he must be able to own the ground and
the resources on which he stands and which he must use. In short, to
sustain his “human right”—or his property rights in his own person—he
must also have the property right in the material world, in the objects
which he produces. Property rights *are* human rights, and are essential
to the human rights which liberals attempt to maintain. The human right
of a free press depends upon the human right of private property in
newsprint.

In fact, there *are no* human rights that are separable from property
rights. The human right of free speech is simply the property right to
hire an assembly hall from the owners, or to own one oneself; the human
right of a free press is the property right to buy materials and then
print leaflets or books and to sell them to those who are willing to
buy. There is no extra “right of free speech” or free press beyond the
property rights we can enumerate in any given case. And furthermore,
discovering and identifying the property rights involved will resolve
any apparent conflicts of rights that may crop up.

Consider, for example, the classic example where liberals generally
concede that a person’s “right of freedom of speech” must be curbed in
the name of the “public interest”: Justice Holmes’ famous dictum that no
one has the right to cry “fire” falsely in a crowded theater. Holmes and
his followers have used this illustration again and again to prove the
supposed necessity for all rights to be relative and tentative rather
than precise and absolute.

But the problem here is *not* that rights cannot be pushed too far but
that the whole case is discussed in terms of a vague and wooly “freedom
of speech” rather than in terms of the rights of private property.
Suppose we analyze the problem under the aspect of property rights. The
fellow who brings on a riot by falsely shouting “fire” in a crowded
theater is, necessarily, either the owner of the theater (or the owner’s
agent) or a paying patron. If he is the owner, then he has committed
fraud on his customers. He has taken their money in exchange for a
promise to put on a movie or play, and now, instead, he disrupts the
show by falsely shouting “fire” and breaking up the performance. He has
thus welshed on his contractual obligation, and has thereby stolen the
property—the money—of his patrons and has violated their property
rights.

Suppose, on the other hand, that the shouter is a patron and not the
owner. In that case, he is violating the property right of the owner—as
well as of the other guests to their paidfor performance. As a guest, he
has gained access to the property on certain terms, including an
obligation not to violate the owner’s property or to disrupt the
performance the owner is putting on. His malicious act, therefore,
violates the property rights of the theater owner and of all the other
patrons.

There is no need, therefore, for individual rights to be restricted in
the case of the false shouter of “fire.” The rights of the individual
are *still* absolute; but they are *property* rights. The fellow who
maliciously cried “fire” in a crowded theater is indeed a criminal, but
*not* because his so-called “right of free speech” must be pragmatically
restricted on behalf of the “public good”; he is a criminal because he
has clearly and obviously violated the property rights of another
person.
