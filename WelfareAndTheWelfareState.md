# 8 WELFARE AND THE WELFARE STATE [15-chap08.html#page175]

## WHY THE WELFARE CRISIS? [why-the-welfare-crisis]

Almost everyone, regardless of ideology, agrees that there is something
terribly wrong with the accelerating, runaway welfare system in the
United States, a system in which an ever-increasing proportion of the
population lives as idle, compulsory claimants on the production of the
rest of society. A few figures and comparisons will sketch in some of
the dimensions of this galloping problem. In 1934, in the middle of the
greatest depression in American history, at a nadir of our economic
life, total government social welfare expenditures were \$5.8 billion,
of which direct welfare payments (“public aid”) amounted to \$2.5
billion. In 1976, after four decades of the greatest boom in American
history, at a time when we had reached the status of having the highest
standard of living in the history of the world with a relatively low
level of unemployment, government social welfare expenditures totalled
\$331.4 billion, of which direct welfare amounted to \$48.9 billion. In
short, total social welfare spending rose by the enormous sum of 5,614
percent in these four decades, and direct welfare aid increased by 1,856
percent. Or, put another way, social welfare spending increased by an
average of 133.7 percent per year during this 1934–1976 period, while
direct welfare aid increased by 44.2 percent per annum.

If we concentrate further on direct welfare, we find that spending
stayed about the same from 1934 to 1950, and then took off into the
stratosphere along with the post-World War II boom. In the years from
1950 to 1976, in fact, welfare aid increased by the huge sum of 84.4
percent per year.

Now some of these enormous increases can be accounted for by inflation,
which diluted the value and purchasing power of the dollar. If we
correct all the figures for inflation by putting them in terms of
“constant 1958 dollars” (i.e., where each dollar has roughly the same
purchasing power that the dollar could command in 1958), then the
relevant figures become as follows: 1934—total social welfare spending,
\$13.7 billion; direct welfare aid, \$5.9 billion. In 1976—total social
welfare spending, \$247.7 billion; direct welfare aid, \$36.5 billion.

Even if we correct the figures for inflation, then, social welfare
spending by the government rose by the vast amount of 1,798 percent, or
42.8 percent per year over these 42 years, while direct welfare aid rose
519 percent, or 12.4 percent per annum. Furthermore, if we look at the
figures for 1950 and for 1976 for direct welfare aid, corrected for
inflation, we find that welfare spending went up, during the intervening
boom years, by 1,077 percent, or 41.4 percent per annum.

If we adjust the figures still further to correct for population growth
(total American population was 126 million in 1934, 215 million in
1976), then we still get an almost tenfold increase in total social
welfare expenditures (from \$108 to \$1,152 per capita in constant 1958
dollars), and a more than tripling of direct public aid (from \$47 in
1934 to \$170 per capita in 1976).

A few more comparisons: from 1955 to 1976—years of great prosperity—the
total number of people on welfare quintupled, from 2.2 to 11.2 million.
From 1952 to 1970, the population of children 18 years old and younger
increased by 42 percent; the number on welfare, however, increased by
400 percent. The total population remained static, yet the number of
welfare recipients in New York City jumped from 330,000 in 1960 to 1.2
million in 1971. Clearly, a welfare crisis is upon
us.^[1](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn1)^

The crisis is shown to be far greater if we include in “welfare
payments” all social welfare aids to the poor. Thus, federal “aid to the
poor” nearly tripled from 1960 to 1969, leaping from \$9.5 billion to
\$27.7 billion. State and local social welfare expenditures zoomed from
\$3.3 billion in 1935 to \$46 billion, a 1,300 percent increase! Total
social welfare expenditures for 1969, federal, state, and local,
amounted to a staggering \$73.7 billion.

Most people think of being on welfare as a process external to the
welfare clients themselves, as almost a natural disaster (like a tidal
wave or volcanic eruption) that occurs beyond and despite the will of
the people on welfare. The usual dictum is that “poverty” is the cause
of individuals or families being on welfare. But on whatever criterion
one wants to define poverty, on the basis of any chosen income level, it
is undeniable that the number of people or families below that “poverty
line” has been steadily *decreasing* since the 1930s, not vice versa.
Thus, the extent of poverty can scarcely account for the spectacular
growth in the welfare clientele.

The solution to the puzzle becomes clear once one realizes that the
number of welfare recipients has what is called in economics a “positive
supply function”; in other words, that when the *incentives* to go on
welfare rise, the welfare rolls will lengthen, and that a similar result
will occur if the *disincentives* to go on welfare become weaker. Oddly
enough, nobody challenges this finding in any *other* area of the
economy. Suppose, for example, that someone (whether the government or a
dotty billionaire is not important here) offers an extra \$10,000 to
everyone who will work in a shoe factory. Clearly, the supply of eager
workers in the shoe business will multiply. The same will happen when
*dis*incentives are reduced, e.g., if the government promises to relieve
every shoe worker from paying income taxes. If we begin to apply the
same analysis to welfare clientele as to all other areas of economic
life, the answer to the welfare puzzle becomes crystal-clear.

What, then, are the important incentives/disincentives for going on
welfare, and how have they been changing? Clearly, an extremely
important factor is the relation between the income to be gained on
welfare, *as compared with* the income to be earned from productive
work. Suppose, to put it simply, that the “average,” or going wage (very
roughly, the wage open to an “average” worker), in a certain area is
\$7,000 a year. Suppose, also, that the income to be obtained from
welfare is \$3,000 a year. This means that the average *net* gain to be
made from working (before taxes) is \$4,000 a year. Suppose now that the
welfare payments go up to \$5,000 (or, alternatively, that the average
wage is reduced to \$5,000). The differential—the net gain to be made
from working—has now been cut in half, reduced from \$4,000 to \$2,000 a
year. It stands to reason that the result will be an enormous increase
in the welfare rolls (which will increase still more when we consider
that the \$7,000 workers will have to pay higher taxes in order to
support a swollen and virtually nontaxpaying welfare clientele). We
would then expect that if—as, of course, has been the case—welfare
payment levels have been rising faster than average wages, an increasing
number of people will flock to the welfare rolls. This effect will be
still greater if we consider that, of course, not everyone earns the
“average”; it will be the “marginal” workers, the ones earning below the
average, who will flock to the welfare rolls. In our example, if the
welfare payment rises to \$5,000 a year, what can we expect to happen to
the workers making \$4,000? \$5,000? or even \$6,000? The \$5,000-a-year
man who previously earned a net of \$2,000 higher than the welfare
client now finds that his differential has been reduced to zero, that he
is making no more—even *less* after taxes!—than the welfare client kept
in idleness by the state. Is it any wonder that he will begin to flock
to the welfare bonanza?

Specifically, during the period between 1952 and 1970, when the welfare
rolls quintupled from 2 to 10 million, the average monthly benefit of a
welfare family more than doubled, from \$82 to \$187, an increase of
almost 130 percent at a time when consumer prices were rising by only 50
percent. Furthermore, in 1968, the Citizens Budget Commission of New
York City compared the ten states in the Union having the fastest rise
in welfare rolls with the ten states enjoying the lowest rate of growth.
The Commission found that the average monthly welfare benefit in the ten
fastest-growing states was twice as high as in the ten slowest states.
(Monthly welfare payments per person averaged \$177 in the former group
of states, and only \$88 in the latter.)^[2](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn2)^

Another example of the impact of high welfare payments and of their
relation to wages available from working was cited by the McCone
Commission investigating the Watts riot of 1965. The Commission found
that a job at the minimum wage paid about \$220 a month, out of which
had to come such work-related expenses as clothing and transportation.
In contrast, the average welfare family in the area received from \$177
to \$238 a month, out of which no work-related expenses had to be
deducted.^[3](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn3)^

Another powerful factor in swelling the welfare rolls is the increasing
disappearance of the various sturdy disincentives for going on welfare.
The leading disincentive has always been the stigma that every person on
the welfare dole used to feel, the stigma of being parasitic and living
off production instead of contributing to production. This stigma has
been socially removed by the permeating values of modern liberalism;
furthermore, the government agencies and social workers themselves have
increasingly rolled out the red carpet to welcome and even urge people
to get on welfare as quickly as possible. The “classical” view of the
social worker was to help people to help themselves, to aid people in
achieving and maintaining their independence and to stand on their own
feet. For welfare clients, the aim of social workers used to be to help
them get *off* the welfare rolls as quickly as possible. But now social
workers have the opposite aim: to try to get as many people *on* welfare
as possible, to advertise and proclaim their “rights.” The result has
been a continuing easing of eligibility requirements, a reduction in red
tape, and the withering away of the enforcing of residency, work, or
even income requirements for being on the dole. Anyone who suggests,
however faintly, that welfare recipients should be required to accept
employment and get off the dole is considered a reactionary moral leper.
And with the old stigma increasingly removed, people now tend more and
more to move rapidly toward welfare instead of shrinking from it. Irving
Kristol has trenchantly written of the “welfare explosion” of the 1960s:

> This “explosion” was created—in part intentionally, in larger part
> unwittingly by public officials and public employees who were
> executing public policies as part of a “War on Poverty.” And these
> policies had been advocated and enacted by many of the same people who
> were subsequently so bewildered by the “welfare explosion.” Not

Here... are the reasons behind the “welfare explosion” of the 1960s:

> 1. The number of poor people who are eligible for welfare will
> increase as one elevates the official definitions of “poverty” and
> “need.” The War on Poverty elevated these official definitions;
> therefore, an increase in the number of “eligibles” automatically

> 2. The number of eligible poor who actually apply for welfare will

The spirit that used to animate the social work profession was a far
different—and a libertarian—one. There were two basic principles: (a)
that all relief and welfare payments should be voluntary, by private
agencies, rather than by the coercive levy of government; and (b) that
the object of giving should be to help the recipient become independent
and productive as soon as possible. Of course, in ultimate logic, (b)
follows from (a), since no private agency is able to tap the virtually
unlimited funds that can be mulcted from the long-suffering taxpayer.
Since private aid funds are strictly limited, there is therefore no room
for the idea of welfare “rights” as an unlimited and permanent claim on
the production of others. As a further corollary of the limitation on
funds, the social workers also realized that there was no room for aid
to malingerers, those who refused to work, or who used the aid as a
racket; hence came the concept of the “deserving” as against the
“undeserving” poor. Thus, the nineteenth-century laissez-faire English
agency, the Charity Organisation Society, included among the undeserving
poor ineligible for aid those who did not need relief, impostors, and
the man whose “condition is due to improvidence or thriftlessness, and
there is no hope of being able to make him independent of charitable...
assistance in the future.”^[5](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn5)^

English laissez-faire liberalism, even though it generally accepted
“Poor Law” governmental welfare, insisted that there be a strong
disincentive effect: not only strict eligibility rules for assistance,
but also making the workhouse conditions unpleasant enough to insure
that workhouse relief would be a strong deterrent rather than an
attractive opportunity. For the “undeserving poor,” those responsible
for their own fate, abuse of the relief system could only be curbed by
“making it as distasteful as possible to the applicants; that is, by
insisting (as a general rule) on a labour test or residence in a
workhouse.”^[6](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn6)^

While a strict deterrent is far better than an open welcome and a
preachment about the recipients’ “rights,” the libertarian position
calls for the complete abolition of governmental welfare and reliance on
private charitable aid, based as it necessarily will be on helping the
“deserving poor” on the road to independence as rapidly as possible.
There was, after all, little or no governmental welfare in the United
States until the Depression of the 1930s and yet—in an era of a far
lower general standard of living—there was no mass starvation in the
streets. A highly successful private welfare program in the present-day
is the one conducted by the three-million-member Mormon Church. This
remarkable people, hounded by poverty and persecution, emigrated to Utah
and nearby states in the nineteenth century, and by thrift and hard work
raised themselves to a general level of prosperity and affluence. Very
few Mormons are on welfare; Mormons are taught to be independent,
self-reliant, and to shun the public dole. Mormons are devout believers
and have therefore successfully internalized these admirable values.
Furthermore, the Mormon Church operates an extensive private welfare
plan for its members—based, again, on the principle of helping their
members toward independence as rapidly as possible.

Note, for example, the following principles from the “Welfare Plan” of
the Mormon Church.

> Ever since its organization in 1830, the Church has encouraged its
> members to establish and maintain their economic independence; it has
> encouraged thrift and fostered the establishment of
> employment-creating industries; it has stood ready at all times to
> help needy faithful members.
>
> In 1936, the Mormon Church developed a
>
> Church Welfare Plan... a system under which the curse of idleness
> would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and
> independence, industry, thrift and self-respect be once more
> established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the
> people to help themselves. Work is to be enthroned as the ruling
> principle of the lives of our Church
> membership.”^[7](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn7)^

Mormon social workers in the program are instructed to act accordingly:

> Faithful to this principle, welfare workers will earnestly teach and
> urge Church members to be self-sustaining to the full extent of their
> powers. No true Latter-Day Saint will, while physically able,
> voluntarily shift from himself the burden of his own support. So long
> as he can, under the inspiration of the Almighty and with his own
> labors, he will supply himself with the necessities of
> life.^[8](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn8)^

The immediate objectives of the welfare program are to:

> 1. Place in gainful employment those who are able to work.
>
> 2. Provide employment within the Welfare Program, in so far as
> possible, for those who cannot be placed in gainful employment. 3.
> Acquire the means with which to supply the needy, for whom the Church
> assumes responsibility, with the necessities of
> life.^[9](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn9)^

Insofar as possible, this program is carried on in small, decentralized,
grass-roots groups:

> Families, neighbors, quorums and wards and other Church organizational
> units may find it wise and desirable to form small groups for
> extending mutual help one to the other. Such groups may plant and
> harvest crops, process foods, store food, clothing and fuel, and carry
> out other projects for their mutual
> benefit.^[10](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn10)^

Specifically, the Mormon bishops and priesthood quorums are enjoined to
aid their brethren to self-help:

> In his temporal administrations the bishop looks at every able-bodied
> needy person as a purely temporary problem, caring for him until he
> can help himself. The priesthood quorum must look at its needy member
> as a continuing problem until not alone his temporal needs are met but
> his spiritual ones also. As a concrete example—a bishop extends help
> while the artisan or craftsman is out of work and in want; a
> priesthood quorum assists in establishing him in work and tries to see
> that he becomes fully self-supporting and active in his priesthood
> duties.

Concrete rehabilitation activities for needy members enjoined upon the
priesthood quorums include:

> 1. Placing quorum members and members of their families in permanent
> jobs. In some instances through trade school training,
> apprenticeships, and in other ways, quorums have assisted their quorum
> members to qualify themselves for better jobs. 2. Assisting quorum
> members and their families to get established in businesses of their
> own.^[11](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn11)^

The prime objective of the Mormon Church is to find jobs for their
needy. To this end,

> The finding of suitable jobs, under the Welfare Program, is a major
> responsibility of priesthood quorum members. They and members of the
> Relief Society should be constantly on the alert for employment
> opportunities. If every member of the ward welfare committee does well
> his or her work in this respect, most of the unemployed will be placed
> in gainful employment at the group or ward
> level.^[12](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn12)^

Other members are rehabilitated as self-employed, the church may aid
with a small loan, and the member’s priesthood quorum may guarantee
repayment from its funds. Those Mormons who cannot be placed in jobs or
rehabilitated as self-employed “are to be given, in so far as possible,
work at productive labor on Church properties.” The Church is insistent
on work by the recipient as far as possible:

> It is imperative that people being sustained through the bishops’
> storehouse program work to the extent of their ability, thus earning
> what they receive. ... Work of an individual on welfare projects
> should be considered as temporary rather than permanent employment. It
> should nevertheless continue so long as assistance is rendered to the
> individual through the bishops storehouse program. In this way the
> spiritual welfare of people will be served as their temporal needs are
> supplied. Feelings of diffidence will be
> removed.^[13](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn13)^

Failing other work, the bishop may assign welfare recipients to aid
individual members who are in need of help, the aided members
reimbursing the Church at prevailing wage rates. In general, in return
for their assistance, the welfare recipients are expected to make
whatever contributions they can to the Church welfare program, either in
funds, produce, or by their labor.^[14](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn14)^

Complementary to this comprehensive system of private aid on the
principle of fostering independence, the Mormon Church sternly
discourages its members from going on public welfare. “It is requested
that local Church officers stress the importance of each individual,
each family and each Church community becoming self-sustaining and
independent of public relief.” And: “To seek and accept direct public
relief all too often invites the curse of idleness and fosters the other
evils of dole. It destroys one’s independence, industry, thrift and
self-respect.”^[15](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn15)^

There is no finer model than the Mormon Church for a private, voluntary,
rational, individualistic welfare program. Let government welfare be
abolished, and one would expect that numerous such programs for rational
mutual aid would spring up throughout the country.

The inspiring example of the Mormon Church is a demonstration that the
major determinant of who or how many people go on public welfare is
their cultural and moral values rather than their level of income.
Another example is the group of Albanian-Americans in New York City.

Albanian-Americans are an extremely poor group, and in New York they are
almost invariably poor slum dwellers. Statistics are scanty, but their
average income is undoubtedly lower than that of the more highly
publicized blacks and Puerto Ricans. Yet there is not a single
Albanian-American on welfare. Why? Because of their pride and
independence. As one of their leaders stated: “Albanians do not beg, and
to Albanians, taking welfare is like begging in the
street.”^[16](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn16)^

A similar case is the decaying, poor, largely Polish-American and almost
totally Catholic community of Northside, in Brooklyn, New York. Despite
the low incomes, blight, and old and deteriorating housing in the area,
there are virtually no welfare recipients in this community of 15,000.
Why? Rudolph J. Stobierski, president of the Northside Community
Development Council, supplied the answer: “They consider welfare an
insult.”^[17](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn17)^

In addition to the impact of religion and ethnic differences on values,
Professor Banfield, in his brilliant book, *The Unheavenly City*, has
demonstrated the importance of what he calls “upper-class” or
“lower-class” culture in influencing the values of their members. The
definitions of “class” in Banfield are not strictly income or status
levels, but they tend to overlap strongly with these more common
definitions. His definitions of class center on the different attitudes
toward the present and the future: upper- and middle-class members tend
to be future-oriented, purposeful, rational, and self-disciplined.
Lower-class people, on the other hand, tend to have a strong
present-orientation, are capricious, hedonistic, purposeless, and
therefore unwilling to pursue a job or a career with any consistency.
People with the former values therefore *tend* to have higher incomes
and better jobs, and lower-class people *tend* to be poor, jobless, or
on welfare. In short, the economic fortunes of people tend over the long
run to be their own internal responsibility, rather than to be
determined—as liberals always insist—by external factors. Thus, Banfield
quotes Daniel Rosenblatt’s findings on the lack of interest in medical
care due to the “general lack of future orientation” among the urban
poor:

> For example, regular checkups of automobiles to detect incipient
> defects are not in the general value system of the urban poor. In
> similar fashion, household objects are often worn out and discarded
> rather than repaired at an early stage of disintegration. Installment
> buying is easily accepted without an awareness of the length of
> payments.
>
> The body can be seen as simply another class of objects to be worn out
> but not repaired. Thus, teeth are left without dental care; later
> there is often small interest in dentures, whether free or not. In any
> event, false teeth may be little used. Corrective eye examinations,
> even for those people who wear glasses, are often neglected—regardless
> of clinic facilities. It is as though the middle class thinks of the
> body as a machine to be preserved and kept in perfect running order
> whether through prosthetic devices, rehabilitation, cosmetic surgery,
> or perpetual treatment, whereas the poor think of the body as having a
> limited span of utility: to be enjoyed in youth and then, with age and
> decrepitude, to be suffered and endured
> stoically.^[18](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn18)^

Banfield points out, furthermore, that lower-class death rates are, and
have been for generations, far higher than for upper-class persons. Much
of the differential is caused not by poverty or low incomes per se, as
much as by the values or culture of the lower-class citizens. Thus,
prominent and particularly lower-class causes of death are alcoholism,
narcotics addiction, homicide, and venereal disease. Infant mortality
has also been far higher among the lower classes, ranging up to two and
three times that of upper groups. That this is due to cultural values
rather than to income level may be seen in Banfield’s comparison of
turn-of-the-century Irish immigrants with Russian Jewish immigrants in
New York City. The Irish immigrants were, in those days, generally
present-minded and “lower class” in attitudes, while the Russian Jews,
though living in overcrowded tenements and on an income level probably
lower than the Irish, were unusually future-minded, purposive, and
“upper class” in their values and attitudes. At the turn of the century,
the life expectancy at the age of ten of an Irish immigrant was only 38
years, whereas for the Russian Jewish immigrant it was more than 50
years. Furthermore, whereas in 1911–1916, in a study of seven cities,
the infant mortality was over three times as high for the lowest as
compared to the highest income groups, the Jewish infant mortality was
extremely low.^[19](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn19)^

As in illness or mortality, so in unemployment—which obviously has a
close relation to both poverty and welfare. Banfield cites the findings
of Professor Michael J. Piore on the essential “unemployability” of many
or most of the persistently low-income unemployed. Piore discovered that
their difficulty was not so much in finding or learning the skills for
steady, well-paying jobs as in the lack of personal fibre in sticking to
such jobs. These people are inclined to high absenteeism, leaving their
jobs without notice, being insubordinate, and sometimes stealing from
the employer.^[20](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn20)^ Furthermore, Peter
Doeringer’s study of the Boston “ghetto” labor market in 1968 found that
about 70 percent of job applicants referred by neighborhood employment
centers received job offers—but that over half of these offers were
rejected, and of those accepted only about 40 percent of the new workers
kept their jobs for as long as one month. Doeringer concluded: “Much of
the ghetto unemployment appears to be a result of work instability
rather than job scarcity.”^[21](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn21)^

It is highly instructive to compare the descriptions of this common
refusal of the lower-class unemployed to engage in steady work by the
frostily disapproving Professor Banfield and by the highly approving
leftist sociologist Alvin Gouldner. Banfield: “Men accustomed to a
street-corner style of life, to living off women on welfare, and to
‘hustling’ are seldom willing to accept the dull routines of the ‘good’
job.”^[22](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn22)^ Pondering the lack of success of
welfare workers in luring these men “away from a life of
irresponsibility, sensuality, and freewheeling aggression,” Gouldner
proclaims that they judge the proferred bargain to be unattractive:

> Give up promiscuous sex, give up freely expressed aggression, and wild
> spontaneity... and you, or your children, may be admitted to the world
> of three square meals a day, to a high school or perhaps even a
> college education, to the world of charge accounts, of secure jobs and
> respectability.”^[23](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn23)^

The interesting point is that from both ends of the ideological spectrum
both Banfield and Gouldner agree on the essential nature of this
process, despite their contrasting value judgments on it: that much of
persistent lower-class unemployment, and hence poverty, is voluntary on
the part of the unemployed themselves.

Gouldner’s attitude is typical of liberals and leftists in the present
day: that it is shameful to try to foist, even noncoercively,
“bourgeois” or “middle-class values” on the gloriously spontaneous and
“natural” lower-class culture. Fair enough, perhaps; but then don’t
expect—or call upon—those same hard-working bourgeoisie to be coerced
into supporting and subsidizing those very parasitic values of idleness
and irresponsibility which they abhor—and which are clearly
dysfunctional for the survival of any society. If people wish to be
“spontaneous,” let them do so on their own time and with their own
resources, and let them then take the consequences of this decision, and
not use State coercion to force the hardworking and “unspontaneous” to
bear those consequences instead. In short, abolish the welfare system.

If the major problem with the lower-class poor is irresponsible
present-mindedness, and if it takes the inculcation of “bourgeois”
future-minded values to get people off welfare and dependency (*pace*
the Mormons), then at the very least these values should be encouraged
and not discouraged in society. The left-liberal attitudes of social
workers discourage the poor directly by fostering the idea of welfare as
a “right” and as a moral claim upon production. Furthermore, the easy
availability of the welfare check obviously promotes present-mindedness,
unwillingness to work, and irresponsibility among the recipients—thus
perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty-welfare. As Banfield puts it,
“there is perhaps no better way to make converts to present-mindedness
than to give a generous welfare check to
everyone.”^[24](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn24)^

Generally, in their attacks on the welfare system conservatives have
focussed on the ethical and moral evils of coercively mulcting the
taxpayers to support the idle, while the leftist critics have
concentrated on the demoralization of the welfare “clients” through
their dependency on the largesse of the State and its bureaucracy.
Actually, both sets of criticisms are right; there is no contradiction
between them. We have seen that voluntary programs such as those of the
Mormon Church are keenly alive to this problem. And in fact, earlier
laissez-faire critics of the dole were just as concerned with the
demoralization as with the coercion over those forced to pay for
welfare.

Thus, the nineteenth-century English laissez-faire advocate Thomas
Mackay declared that welfare reform “consists in a re-creation and
development of the arts of independence.” He called “not for more
philanthropy, but rather for more respect for the dignity of human life,
and more faith in its ability to work out its own salvation.” And Mackay
poured his scorn on the advocates of greater welfare, on

> popularity, uses the rate \[tax\] extorted from his neighbors to
> multiply the occasions of stumbling set before the... crowd who are
> only too ready to fall into

Mackay added that the

> “introduces a most dangerous and at times demoralising influence into
> our social arrangements. Its real necessity is by no means proved. Its
> apparent necessity arises mainly from the fact that the system has

Elaborating on the theme of dependence, Mackay observed that

> feeling cannot be removed, but is rather intensified by liberal

Mackay concluded that

The Charity Organisation Society, England’s leading private charity
agency in the late nineteenth century, operated precisely on this
principle of aid to foster self-help. As Mowat, the historian of the
Society notes:

> The C.O.S. embodied an idea of charity which claimed to reconcile the
> divisions in society, to remove poverty and to produce a happy,
> self-reliant community. It believed that the most serious aspect of
> poverty was the degradation of the character of the poor man or woman.

> charity demanded friendship, thought, the sort of help that would
> restore a man’s self-respect and his ability to support himself and
> his family.^[29](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn29)^

Perhaps one of the grimmest consequences of welfare is that it actively
discourages self-help by crippling the financial incentive for
rehabilitation. It has been estimated that, on the average, every dollar
invested by handicapped persons in their own rehabilitation brings them
from \$10 to \$17 in the present value of increased future earnings. But
this incentive is crippled by the fact that, by becoming rehabilitated,
they will lose their welfare relief, Social Security disability
payments, and workmen’s compensation. As a result, most of the disabled
decide not to invest in their own
rehabilitation.^[30](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn30)^ Many people, moreover,
are by now familiar with the crippling disincentive effects of the
Social Security system, which—in glaring contrast to all private
insurance funds—cuts off payments if the recipient should be brazen
enough to work and earn an income after age 62.

In these days, when most people look askance at population growth, few
antipopulationists have focussed on another unfortunate effect of the
welfare system: Since welfare families are paid proportionately to the
number of their children, the system provides an important subsidy for
the production of more children. Furthermore, the people being induced
to have more children are precisely those who can afford it least; the
result can only be to perpetuate their dependence on welfare, and, in
fact, to develop generations who are permanently dependent on the
welfare dole.

In recent years, there has been a great deal of agitation for the
government to supply day-care centers to care for children of working
mothers. Allegedly the market has failed to supply this much needed
service.

Since the market is in the business of meeting urgent consumer demands,
however, the question to ask is *why* the market seems to have failed in
this particular case. The answer is that the government has ringed the
supply of day-care service with a network of onerous and costly legal
restrictions. In short: while it is perfectly legal to deposit one’s
children with a friend or relative, no matter who the person is or the
condition of his apartment, or to hire a neighbor who will be taking
care of one or two children, let the friend or neighbor become a
slightly bigger business, and the State cracks down with a vengeance.
Thus, the State will generally insist that such day-care centers be
licensed and will refuse to grant the license unless registered nurses
are in attendance at all times, minimal playground facilities are
available, and the facility is of a minimum size. There will be all
sorts of other absurd and costly restrictions which the government does
not bother to impose on friends, relatives, and neighbors—or, indeed, on
mothers themselves. Remove these restrictions, and the market will go to
work to meet the demand.

For the past thirteen years the poet Ned O’Gorman has been operating a
successful, privately financed day-care center in Harlem on a
shoestring, but he is in danger of being put out of business by
bureaucratic restrictions imposed by the New York City government. While
the city admits the “dedication and effectiveness” of O’Gorman’s center,
The Storefront, it is threatening fines and ultimately the coercive
closing of the center unless he has a state-certified social worker
present whenever there are five or more children in attendance. As
O’Gorman indignantly remarks:

> Why on earth should I be forced to hire someone with a piece of paper
> that says they’ve studied social work and are qualified to run a
> day-care center? If I’m not qualified after thirteen years in Harlem,
> then who is?^[31](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn31)^

The example of day care demonstrates an important truth about the
market: if there seems to be a shortage of supply to meet an evident
demand, then look to government as the cause of the problem. Give the
market its head, and there will be no shortages of day-care centers,
just as there are no shortages of motels, of washing machines, of TV
sets, or of any of the other accoutrements of daily living.

## BURDENS AND SUBSIDIES OF THE WELFARE STATE [burdens-and-subsidies-of-the-welfare-state]

Does the modern welfare state really help the poor? The commonly held
notion, the idea that has propelled the welfare state and maintained it
in being, is that the welfare state redistributes income and wealth from
the rich to the poor: the progressive tax system takes money from the
rich while numerous welfare and other services distribute the money to
the poor. But even liberals, the great advocates and abettors of the
welfare state, are beginning to realize that every part and aspect of
this idea is merely a cherished myth. Government contracts, notably of
the military, funnel tax funds into the pockets of favored corporations
and well-paid industrial workers. Minimum wage laws tragically generate
unemployment, especially so among the poorest and least skilled or
educated workers—in the South, among teenage Negroes in the ghettoes,
and among the vocationally handicapped. Because a minimum wage, of
course, does not guarantee any worker’s employment; it only prohibits,
by force of law, anyone from being employed at the wage which would pay
his employer to hire him. It therefore compels unemployment. Economists
have demonstrated that raises in the federal minimum wage have created
the well-known Negro-white teenage employment gap, and have driven the
rate of male Negro teenage unemployment from an early postwar rate of
about 8 percent to what is now well over 35 percent—an unemployment rate
among teenage Negroes that is far more catastrophic than the massive
general unemployment rate of the 1930s (20–25
percent).^[32](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn32)^

We have already seen how State higher education redistributes income
from poorer to wealthier citizens. A host of government licensing
restrictions, permeating occupation after occupation, exclude poorer and
less skilled workers from these jobs. It is becoming recognized that
urban renewal programs, supposedly designed to aid the slum housing of
the poor, in fact demolish their housing and force the poor into more
crowded and less available housing, all for the benefit of wealthier
subsidized tenants, construction unions, favored real estate developers,
and downtown business interests. Unions, once the pampered favorites of
liberals, are now generally seen to use their governmental privileges to
exclude poorer and minority-group workers. Farm price supports, jacked
ever higher by the federal government, mulct the taxpayers in order to
push food prices higher and higher, thereby injuring particularly the
poor consumers and helping—*not* poor farmers, but the wealthy farmers
commanding a large amount of acreage. (Since farmers are paid per pound
or per bushel of product, the support program largely benefits the
wealthy farmers; in fact, since farmers are often paid *not* to produce,
the resulting taking of acreage out of production causes severe
unemployment among the poorest segment of the farm population—the farm
tenants and farm workers.) Zoning laws in the burgeoning suburbs of the
United States serve to keep out the poorer citizens by legal coercion,
very often Negroes who are attempting to move out of the inner cities to
follow increasing job opportunities in the suburbs. The U.S. Postal
Service charges high monopoly rates on the first-class mail used by the
general public in order to subsidize the distribution of newspapers and
magazines. The FHA subsidizes the mortgages of well-to-do homeowners.
The Federal Bureau of Reclamation subsidizes irrigation water to
well-to-do farmers in the West, thereby depriving the urban poor of
water and forcing them to pay higher water charges. The Rural
Electrification Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority
subsidize electric service to well-to-do farmers, suburbanites, and
corporations. As Professor Brozen sardonically observes:

> Electricity for poverty-stricken corporations such as the Aluminum
> Corporation of America and the DuPont Company is subsidized by the
> tax-free status of the Tennessee Valley Authority (27 percent of the
> price of electricity goes to pay the taxes imposed on privately
> operated utilities).^[33](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn33)^

And the government regulation monopolizes and cartelizes much of
industry, thereby driving up prices to consumers and restricting
production, competitive alternatives, or improvements in products (e.g.,
railroad regulation, public utility regulation, airline regulation, oil
proration laws). Thus, the Civil Aeronautics Board allocates airline
routes to favored companies and keeps out and even drives out of
business smaller competitors. State and federal oil proration laws
provide for absolute maximum limits on crude oil production, thereby
driving up oil prices, prices that are further kept up by import
restrictions. And government throughout the country grants an absolute
monopoly in each area to gas, electric, and telephone companies, thus
protecting them from competition, and sets their rates in order to
guarantee them a fixed profit. Everywhere and in every area the story is
the same: a systematic mulcting of the mass of the population by the
“welfare state.”^[34](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn34)^

Most people believe that the American tax system basically taxes the
rich far more than it taxes the poor and is therefore a method of
redistributing income from higher to lower income classes. (There are,
of course, many *other* kinds of redistribution, e.g., from the
taxpayers to Lockheed or General Dynamics.) But even the federal income
tax, which everybody assumes to be “progressive” (taxing the rich far
more than the poor, with the middle classes in between), does not really
work that way when we take into account other aspects of this tax. For
example, the Social Security tax is blatantly and starkly “regressive,”
since it is a soak-the-poor-and-middle-class tax: a person making the
base income (\$8,000) pays fully as much Social Security tax—and the
amount is rising every year—as someone making \$1,000,000 a year.
Capital gains, mostly accruing to wealthy stockholders and owners of
real estate, pay far less than income taxes; private trusts and
foundations are tax exempt, and interest earned on state and municipal
government bonds is also exempt from the federal income tax. We wind up
with the following estimate of what percentage of income is paid,
overall, by each “income class” in federal taxes:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image](209_img01.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If federal taxes are scarcely “progressive,” the impact of state and
local taxes is almost fiercely regressive. Property taxes are (a)
proportional, (b) hit only owners of real estate, and (c) depend on the
political vagaries of local assessors. Sales and excise taxes hit the
poor more than anyone else. The following is the estimate of the
percentage of income extracted, overall, by state and local taxes:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image](210_img01.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following are the combined estimates for the total impact of
taxation—federal, state, and local—on income classes:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image](210_img02.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Still more recent (1968) estimates of the total impact of taxes on all
levels of government amply confirm the above, while also showing a far
greater relative rise in the three years of the tax burden on the lowest
income groups:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image](211_img01.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many economists try to mitigate the impact of these telltale figures by
saying that the people in the “Under \$2,000” category, for example,
receive more in welfare and other “transfer” payments than they pay out
in taxes; but of course this ignores the vital fact that the *same*
people in each category are *not* the welfare receivers *and* the
taxpayers. The latter group is socked heavily in order to subsidize the
former. In short, the poor (and the middle class) are taxed in order to
pay for the subsidized public housing of *other* poor—*and*
middle-income groups. And it is the working poor who are socked a
staggering amount to pay for the subsidies of the welfare poor.

There is plenty of income redistribution in this country: to Lockheed,
to welfare recipients, and so on and on, but the “rich” are not being
taxed to pay for the “poor.” The redistribution is *within* income
categories; some poor are forced to pay for other poor.

Other tax estimates confirm this chilling picture. The Tax Foundation,
for example, estimates that federal, state, and local taxes extract 34
percent of the overall income of those who make less than \$3,000 a
year.^[37](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn37)^

The object of this discussion is not, of course, to advocate a “really”
progressive income tax structure, a real soaking of the rich, but to
point out that the modern welfare state, highly touted as soaking the
rich to subsidize the poor, does no such thing. In fact, soaking the
rich would have disastrous effects, not just for the rich but for the
poor and middle classes themselves. For it is the rich who provide a
proportionately greater amount of saving, investment capital,
entrepreneurial foresight, and financing of technological innovation
that has brought the United States to by far the highest standard of
living—for the mass of the people—of any country in history. Soaking the
rich would not only be profoundly immoral, it would drastically penalize
the very virtues: thrift, business foresight, and investment, that have
brought about our remarkable standard of living. It would truly be
killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.

## WHAT CAN GOVERNMENT DO? [what-can-government-do]

What, then, *can* the government do to help the poor? The only correct
answer is also the libertarian answer: Get out of the way. Let the
government get out of the way of the productive energies of all groups
in the population, rich, middle class, and poor alike, and the result
will be an enormous increase in the welfare and the standard of living
of everyone, and most particularly of the poor who are the ones
supposedly helped by the miscalled “welfare state.”

There are four major ways in which the government can get out of the way
of the American people. First, it can abolish—or at the very least
drastically reduce—the level of all taxation, taxation which cripples
productive energies, savings, investment, and technological advance. In
fact, the creation of jobs and increase of wage rates resulting from
abolishing these taxes would benefit the lower-income groups *more* than
anyone else. As Professor Brozen points out:

> With less attempt to use state power to compress the inequality in the
> distribution of income, inequality would diminish more rapidly. Low
> wage rates would rise more rapidly with a higher rate of saving and
> capital formation, and inequality would diminish with the rise in
> income of wage earners.^[38](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn38)^

The best way to help the poor is to slash taxes and allow savings,
investment, and creation of jobs to proceed unhampered. As Dr. F.A.
Harper pointed out years ago, productive investment is the “greatest
economic charity.” Wrote Harper:

> According to one view, sharing a crust of bread is advocated as the
> method of charity. The other advocates savings and tools for the
> production of additional loaves of bread, which is the greatest
> economic charity.

> The two views are in conflict because the two methods are mutually

The libertarian writer Isabel Paterson put the case eloquently:

> As between the private philanthropist and the private capitalist
> acting as such, take the case of the truly needy man, who is not
> incapacitated, and suppose that the philanthropist gives him food and
> clothes and shelter—when he has used them, he is just where he was

Second, and as a corollary to a drastic reduction or abolition of
taxation, would come an equivalent reduction in government expenditures.
No longer would scarce economic resources be siphoned off into wasteful
and unproductive expenditures: *into* the multibillion dollar space
program, public works, the military-industrial complex, or whatever.
Instead, these resources would be available to produce goods and
services desired by the mass of the consuming population. The outpouring
of goods and services would provide new and better goods to the
consumers at far lower prices. No longer would we suffer the
inefficiencies and the injury to productivity of government subsidies
and contracts. Furthermore, the diversion of most of the nation’s
scientists and engineers to wasteful military and other governmental
research and expenditure would be released for peaceful and productive
activities and inventions benefiting the nation’s
consumers.^[41](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn41)^

Third, if the government also cut out the numerous ways in which it
taxes the poorer to subsidize the wealthier, such as we have named above
(higher education, farm subsidies, irrigation, Lockheed, etc.), this in
itself would stop the government’s deliberate exactions upon the poor.
By ceasing to tax the poorer in order to subsidize the richer, the
government would aid the poor by removing its burdens from their
productive activity.

Finally, one of the most significant ways in which the government could
aid the poor is by removing its own direct roadblocks from their
productive energies. Thus, minimum wage laws disemploy the poorest and
least productive members of the population. Government privileges to
trade unions enable them to keep the poorer and minority-group workers
from productive and high-wage employment. And licensing laws, the
outlawing of gambling, and other government restrictions prevent the
poor from starting small businesses and creating jobs on their own.
Thus, the government has everywhere clamped onerous restrictions on
peddling, ranging from outright prohibition to heavy license fees.
Peddling was the classic path by which immigrants, poor and lacking
capital, were able to become entrepreneurs and eventually to become big
businessmen. But now this route has been cut off—largely to confer
monopoly privileges on each city’s retail stores, who fear that they
would lose profits if faced with the highly mobile competition of street
peddlers.

Typical of how government has frustrated the productive activities of
the poor is the case of the neurosurgeon Dr. Thomas Matthew, founder of
the black self-help organization NEGRO, which floats bonds to finance
its operations. In the mid-1960s, Dr. Matthew, over the opposition of
the New York City government, established a successful interracial
hospital in the black section of Jamaica, Queens. He soon found,
however, that public transportation in Jamaica was so abysmal that
transportation service was totally inadequate for the hospital’s
patients and staff. Finding bus service inadequate, Dr. Matthew
purchased a few busses and established a regular bus service in Jamaica,
service that was regular, efficient, and successful. The problem was
that Dr. Matthew did not have a city license to operate a bus line—that
privilege is reserved to inefficient but protected monopolies. The
ingenious Dr. Matthew, discovering that the city did not allow any
unlicensed busses to charge fares, made his bus service free, except
that any riders who wished could buy a 25¢ company bond instead whenever
they rode the busses.

So successful was the Matthew bus service that he proceeded to establish
another bus line in Harlem; but it was at this point, in early 1968,
that the New York City government took fright and cracked down. The
government went to court and put both lines out of business for
operating without licenses.

A few years later, Dr. Matthew and his colleagues seized an unused
building in Harlem owned by the city government. (The New York City
government is the city’s biggest “slumlord,” owning as it does a vast
amount of useful buildings abandoned because of nonpayment of high
property taxes and rotting away, rendered useless and uninhabitable.) In
this building, Dr. Matthew established a low-cost hospital—at a time of
soaring hospital costs and scarcity of hospital space. The city finally
succeeded in putting this hospital, too, out of business, claiming “fire
violations.” Again and again, in area after area, the role of government
has been to thwart the economic activities of the poor. It is no wonder
that when Dr. Matthew was asked by a white official of the New York City
government how it could best aid Negro self-help projects, Matthew
replied: “Get out of our way, and let us try something.”

Another example of how government functions occurred a few years ago,
when the federal and New York City governments loudly proclaimed that
they would rehabilitate a group of 37 buildings in Harlem. But instead
of following the usual practice of private industry and awarding
rehabilitation contracts on each house individually, the government
instead awarded one contract on the entire 37-building package. By doing
so, the government made sure that small, black-owned construction firms
would not be able to bid, and so the prize contract naturally went to a
large white-owned company. Still another example: In 1966, the federal
Small Business Administration proudly proclaimed a program for
encouraging new black-owned small business. But the government put
certain key restrictions on its loans. First, it decided that any
borrower must be “at the poverty level.” Now since the very poor are not
apt to be setting up their own businesses, this restriction ruled out
many small businesses by owners with moderately low incomes—just the
ones likely to be small entrepreneurs. To top this, the New York SBA
added a further restriction: All blacks seeking such loans must “prove a
real need in their community” for filling a recognizable “economic
void”—the need and the void to be proved to the satisfaction of remote
bureaucrats far from the actual economic
scene.^[42](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn42)^

A fascinating gauge of whether or to what extent government is helping
or hurting the poor in the “welfare state” is provided by an unpublished
study by the Institute for Policy Studies of Washington, D.C. An inquiry
was made on the estimated flow of government money (federal and
district) into the low-income Negro ghetto of Shaw-Cardozo in
Washington, D.C., as compared to the *outflow* that the area pays in
taxes to the government. In fiscal 1967, the Shaw-Cardozo area had a
population of 84,000 (of whom 79,000 were black) with a median family
income of \$5,600 per year. Total earned personal income for the
residents of the area for that year amounted to \$126.5 million. The
value of total government benefits flowing into the district (ranging
from welfare payments to the estimated expenditure on public schools)
during fiscal 1967 was estimated at \$45.7 million. A generous subsidy,
amounting to almost 40 percent of total Shaw-Cardozo income? Perhaps,
but against this we have to offset the total outflow of taxes from
Shaw-Cardozo, best estimated at \$50.0 million—a net *outflow* from this
low—income ghetto of \$4.3 million! Can it still be maintained that
abolition of the entire massive, unproductive welfare state structure
would hurt the poor?^[43](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn43)^

Government could then best help the poor—and the rest of society—by
getting out of the way: by removing its vast and crippling network of
taxes, subsidies, inefficiencies, and monopoly privileges. As Professor
Brozen summed up his analysis of the “welfare state”:

> The state has typically been a device for producing affluence for a
> few at the expense of many. The market has produced affluence for many
> with little cost even to a few. The state has not changed its ways
> since Roman days of bread and circuses for the masses, even though it
> now pretends to provide education and medicine as well as free milk
> and performing arts. It still is the source of monopoly privilege and
> power for the few behind its facade of providing welfare for the
> many—welfare which would be more abundant if politicians would not
> expropriate the means they use to provide the illusion that they care
> about their constituents.^[44](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn44)^

## THE NEGATIVE INCOME TAX [the-negative-income-tax]

Unfortunately, the recent trend—embraced by a wide spectrum of advocates
(with unimportant modifications) from President Nixon to Milton Friedman
on the right to a large number on the left—is to abolish the current
welfare system *not* in the direction of freedom but toward its very
opposite. This new trend is the “guaranteed annual income” or “negative
income tax,” or President Nixon’s “Family Assistance Plan.” Citing the
inefficiencies, inequities, and red tape of the present system, the
guaranteed annual income would make the dole easy, “efficient,” and
automatic: The income tax authorities will pay money each year to
families earning below a certain base income—this automatic dole to be
financed, of course, by taxing working families making *more* than the
base amount. Estimated costs of this seemingly neat and simple scheme
are supposed to be only a few billion dollars per year.

But there is an extremely important catch: the costs are estimated *on
the assumption* that everyone—the people on the universal dole as well
as those financing it—will continue to work to the same extent as
before. But this assumption begs the question. For the chief problem is
the enormously crippling disincentive effect the guaranteed annual
income will have on taxpayer and recipient alike.

The one element that saves the present welfare system from being an
utter disaster is precisely the red tape and the stigma involved in
going on welfare. The welfare recipient still bears a psychic stigma,
even though weakened in recent years, and he still has to face a
typically inefficient, impersonal, and tangled bureaucracy. But the
guaranteed annual income, *precisely* by making the dole efficient,
easy, and automatic, will remove the major obstacles, the major
disincentives, to the “supply function” for welfare, and will lead to a
massive flocking to the guaranteed dole. Moreover, everyone will now
consider the new dole as an automatic “right” rather than as a privilege
or gift, and all stigma will be removed.

Suppose, for example, that \$4,000 per year is declared the “poverty
line,” and that everyone earning income below that line receives the
difference from Uncle Sam automatically as a result of filling out his
income tax return. Those making zero income will receive \$4,000 from
the government, those making \$3,000 will get \$1,000, and so on. It
seems clear that there will be no real reason for *anyone* making less
than \$4,000 a year to keep on working. Why should he, when his
nonworking neighbor will wind up with the same income as himself? In
short, the *net* income from working will then be zero, and the entire
working population below the magic \$4,000 line will quit work and flock
to its “rightful” dole.

But this is not all; what of the people making either \$4,000, or
slightly or even moderately above that line? The man making \$4,500 a
year will soon find that the lazy slob next door who refuses to work
will be getting his \$4,000 a year from the federal government; his own
net income from forty hours a week of hard work will be only \$500 a
year. So he will quit work and go on the negative-tax dole. The same
will undoubtedly hold true for those making \$5,000 a year, etc.

The baleful process is not over. As all the people making below \$4,000
and even considerably above \$4,000 leave work and go on the dole, the
total dole payments will skyrocket enormously, and they can only be
financed by taxing *more* heavily the higher income folk who will
continue to work. But then *their* net, after-tax incomes will fall
sharply, until many of *them* will quit work and go on the dole too. Let
us contemplate the man making \$6,000 a year. He is, at the outset,
faced with a net income from working of only \$2,000, and if he has to
pay, let us say, \$500 a year to finance the dole of the nonworkers, his
net after-tax income will be only \$1,500 a year. If he then has to pay
*another* \$1,000 to finance the rapid expansion of others on the dole,
his net income will fall to \$500 and he will go on the dole. Thus, the
logical conclusion of the guaranteed annual income will be a vicious
spiral into disaster, heading toward the logical and impossible goal of
virtually no one working, and everyone on the dole.

In addition to all this, there are some important extra considerations.
In practice, of course, the dole, once set at \$4,000, will not remain
there; irresistible pressure by welfare clients and other pressure
groups will inexorably raise the base level every year, thereby bringing
the vicious spiral and economic disaster that much closer. In practice,
too, the guaranteed annual income will *not*, as in the hopes of its
conservative advocates, *replace* the existing patchwork welfare system;
it will simply be added *on top of* the existing programs. This, for
example, is precisely what happened to the states’ old-age relief
programs. The major talking point of the New Deal’s federal Social
Security program was that it would efficiently *replace* the then
existing patchwork old-age relief programs of the states. In practice,
of course, it did no such thing, and old-age relief is far higher now
than it was in the 1930s. An ever-rising Social Security structure was
simply placed on top of existing programs. In practice, finally,
President Nixon’s sop to conservatives that able-bodied recipients of
the new dole would be forced to work is a patent phony. They would, for
one thing, only have to find “suitable” work, and it is the universal
experience of state unemployment relief agencies that almost no
“suitable” jobs are ever found.^[45](#24-notes.html#chap08_fn45)^

The various schemes for a guaranteed annual income are no genuine
replacement for the universally acknowledged evils of the welfare
system; they would only plunge us still more deeply into those evils.
The only workable solution is the libertarian one: the abolition of the
welfare dole in favor of freedom and voluntary action for all persons,
rich and poor alike.
