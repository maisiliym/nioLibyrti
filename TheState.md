# The State

## The State as Aggressor

Almost all persons and schools of thought oppose the exercise of random
violence against persons and property.

A “district attorney” prosecutes criminals in the name of a nonexistent
“society,” even against the wishes of the victim of crime. It is the victim who
must decide whether to press charges. Furthermore, the victim must be able to
press suit against a wrongdoer without having to convince the same district
attorney that he should proceed. The emphasis must never be on “society’s”
jailing the criminal; the emphasis must necessarily be on compelling the
criminal to make restitution to the victim of his crime. For the victim to pay
taxes to support the incarceration of his own attacker is evident nonsense.

There must be no governmental machinery that pursues and tries criminals even
against the wishes of the victim.

The State is the supreme, the eternal, the best organized aggressor against the
persons and property of the mass of the public. *All* States everywhere,
whether democratic, dictatorial, or monarchical, whether red, white, blue, or
turquoise.

The State! Always and ever the government and its rulers and operators have
been considered above the general moral law.  Service to the State is supposed
to excuse all actions that would be considered immoral or criminal if committed
by “private” citizens.  The law must be uncompromisingly applied to people
acting in their roles as members of the State apparatus. For centuries,
individuals acting in their roles as “members of the government” have cloaked
their criminal activity in highsounding rhetoric. For centuries they have
committed mass murder and called it “war”; then ennobled the mass slaughter
that “war” involves. For centuries they have enslaved people into their armed
battalions and called it “conscription” in the “national service.” For
centuries they have robbed people at bayonet point and called it “taxation.”

No constitution can interpret or enforce itself; it must be interpreted by
*men*. And if the ultimate power to interpret a constitution is given to the
government’s own Supreme Court, then the inevitable tendency is for the Court
to continue to place its imprimatur on ever-broader powers for its own
government.

Even if 90 percent of the people decided to murder or enslave the other 10
percent, this would *still* be murder and slavery. Crime is crime, aggression
against rights is aggression, no matter how many citizens agree to the
oppression. There is nothing sacrosanct about the majority.

At first, of course, it is startling for someone to consider taxation as
robbery, and therefore government as a band of robbers. But anyone who
persists in thinking of taxation as in some sense a “voluntary” payment
can see what happens if he chooses not to pay. The great economist
Joseph Schumpeter, himself by no means a libertarian, wrote that “the
state has been living on a revenue which was being produced in the
private sphere for private purposes and had to be deflected from these
purposes by political force. The theory which construes taxes on the
analogy of club dues or of the purchase of the services of, say, a
doctor only proves how far removed this part of the social sciences is
from scientific habits of mind.”^[4](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn4)^ The
eminent Viennese “legal positivist” Hans Kelsen attempted, in his
treatise, *The General Theory of Law and the State*, to establish a
political theory and justification of the State, on a strictly
“scientific” and value-free basis. What happened is that early in the
book, he came to the crucial stickingpoint, the *pons asinorum* of
political philosophy: *What* distinguishes the edicts of the State from
the commands of a bandit gang? Kelsen’s answer was simply to say that
the decrees of the State are “valid,” and to proceed happily from there,
without bothering to define or explain this concept of “validity.”
Indeed, it would be a useful exercise for nonlibertarians to ponder this
question: *How* can you define taxation in a way which makes it
different from robbery?

To the great nineteenth-century individualist anarchist—and
constitutional lawyer—Lysander Spooner, there was no problem in finding
the answer. Spooner’s analysis of the State as robber group is perhaps
the most devastating ever written:

> It is true that the *theory* of our Constitution is, that all taxes
> are paid voluntarily; that our government is a mutual insurance
> company, voluntarily entered into by the people with each other. ...

> But this theory of our government is wholly different from the

If the State is a group of plunderers, *who* then constitutes the State?
Clearly, the ruling elite consists at any time of (a) the full-time
*apparatus*—the kings, politicians, and bureaucrats who man and operate
the State; and (b) the groups who have maneuvered to gain privileges,
subsidies, and benefices from the State. The remainder of society
constitutes the ruled. It was, again, John C. Calhoun who saw with
crystal clarity that, no matter how small the power of government, no
matter how low the tax burden or how equal its distribution, the very
nature of government creates two unequal and inherently conflicting
classes in society: those who, on net, *pay* the taxes (the
“tax-payers”), and those who, on net, *live off* taxes (the
“tax-consumers”). Suppose that the government imposes a low and
seemingly equally distributed tax to pay for building a dam. This very
act takes money from most of the public to pay it out to net
“tax-consumers”: the bureaucrats who run the operation, the contractors
and workers who build the dam, etc. And the greater the scope of
government decision-making, the greater its fiscal burdens, Calhoun went
on, the greater the burden and the artificial inequality it imposes
between these two classes:

> Few, comparatively, as they are, the agents and employees of the
> government constitute that portion of the community who are the
> exclusive recipients of the proceeds of the taxes. Whatever amount is
> taken from the community in the form of taxes, if not lost, goes to
> them in the shape of expenditures or disbursements. The
> two—disbursement and taxation—constitute the fiscal action of the
> government. They are correlatives. What the one takes from the
> community under the name of taxes is transferred to the portion of the
> community who are the recipients under that of disbursements. But as
> the recipients constitute only a portion of the community, it follows,
> taking the two parts of the fiscal process together, that its action
> must be unequal between the payers of the taxes and the recipients of
> their proceeds. Nor can it be otherwise; unless what is collected from
> each individual in the shape of taxes shall be returned to him in that
> of disbursements, which would make the process nugatory and absurd.
> ...
>
> The necessary result, then, of the unequal fiscal action of the
> government is to divide the community into two great classes: one
> consisting of those who, in reality, pay the taxes and, of course,
> bear exclusively the burden of supporting the government; and the
> other, of those who are the recipients of their proceeds through
> disbursements, and who are, in fact, supported by the government; or,
> in fewer words, to divide it into tax-payers and tax-consumers.
>

If states have everywhere been run by an oligarchic group of predators,
how have they been able to maintain their rule over the mass of the
population? The answer, as the philosopher David Hume pointed out over
two centuries ago, is that in the long run *every* government, no matter
how dictatorial, rests on the support of the majority of its subjects.
Now this does not of course render these governments “voluntary,” since
the very existence of the tax and other coercive powers shows how much
compulsion the State must exercise. Nor does the majority support have
to be eager and enthusiastic approval; it could well be mere passive
acquiescence and resignation. The conjunction in the famous phrase
“death and taxes” implies a passive and resigned acceptance to the
assumed inevitability of the State and its taxation.

The tax-consumers, the groups that benefit from the operations of the
State, will of course be eager rather than passive followers of the
State mechanism. But these are only a minority. How is the compliance
and acquiescence of the mass of the population to be secured? Here we
come to the central problem of political philosophy—that branch of
philosophy that deals with politics, the exercise of regularized
violence: the mystery of civil obedience. Why do people obey the edicts
and depredations of the ruling elite? Conservative writer James Burnham,
who is the reverse of libertarian, put the problem very clearly,
admitting that there is no rational justification for civil obedience:
“Neither the source nor the justification of government can be put in
wholly rational terms... why should I accept the hereditary or
democratic or any other principle of legitimacy? Why should a principle
justify the rule of that man over me?” His own answer is hardly
calculated to convince many others: “I accept the principle, well...
because I do, because that is the way it is and has
been.”^[7](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn7)^ But suppose that one does *not*
accept the principle; what will the “way” be then? And why have the bulk
of subjects agreed to accept it?

## THE STATE AND THE INTELLECTUALS [9-chap03.html#page67]

The answer is that, since the early origins of the State, its rulers
have always turned, as a necessary bolster to their rule, to an alliance
with society’s class of intellectuals. The masses do not create their
own abstract ideas, or indeed think through these ideas independently;
they follow passively the ideas adopted and promulgated by the body of
intellectuals, who become the effective “opinion moulders” in society.
And since it is precisely a moulding of opinion on behalf of the rulers
that the State almost desperately needs, this forms a firm basis for the
age-old alliance of the intellectuals and the ruling classes of the
State. The alliance is based on a *quid pro quo*: on the one hand, the
intellectuals spread among the masses the idea that the State and its
rulers are wise, good, sometimes divine, and at the very least
inevitable and better than any conceivable alternatives. In return for
this panoply of ideology, the State incorporates the intellectuals as
part of the ruling elite, granting them power, status, prestige, and
material security. Furthermore, intellectuals are needed to staff the
bureaucracy and to “plan” the economy and society.

Before the modern era, particularly potent among the intellectual
handmaidens of the State was the priestly caste, cementing the powerful
and terrible alliance of warrior chief and medicine man, of Throne and
Altar. The State “established” the Church and conferred upon it power,
prestige, and wealth extracted from its subjects. In return, the Church
anointed the State with divine sanction and inculcated this sanction
into the populace. In the modern era, when theocratic arguments have
lost much of their lustre among the public, the intellectuals have posed
as the scientific cadre of “experts” and have been busy informing the
hapless public that political affairs, foreign and domestic, are much
too complex for the average person to bother his head about. Only the
State and its corps of intellectual experts, planners, scientists,
economists, and “national security managers” can possibly hope to deal
with these problems. The role of the masses, even in “democracies,” is
to ratify and assent to the decisions of their knowledgeable rulers.

Historically, the union of Church and State, of Throne and Altar, has
been the most effective device for inducing obedience and support among
the subjects. Burnham attests to the power of myth and mystery in
inducing support when he writes that, “In ancient times, before the
illusions of science had corrupted traditional wisdom, the founders of
Cities were known to be gods or
demi-gods.”^[8](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn8)^ To the established
priestcraft, the ruler was either anointed by God or, in the case of the
absolute rule of many Oriental despotisms, was even himself God; hence,
any questioning or resistance to his rule would be blasphemy.

Many and subtle are the ideological weapons the State and its
intellectuals have used over the centuries to induce their subjects to
accept their rule. One excellent weapon has been the power of
*tradition*. The longer lasting the rule of any given State, the more
powerful this weapon; for then the X-Dynasty or the Y-State has the
seeming weight of centuries of tradition behind it. Worship of one’s
ancestors then becomes a none-too-subtle means of cultivating worship of
one’s ancestral rulers. The force of tradition is, of course, bolstered
by ancient *habit*, which confirms the subjects in the seeming propriety
and legitimacy of the rule under which they live. Thus, the political
theorist Bertrand De Jouvenel has written:

> The essential reason for obedience is that it has become a habit of
> the species. ... Power is for us a fact of nature. From the earliest
> days of recorded history it has always presided over human
> destinies... the authorities which ruled... in former times did not
> disappear without bequeathing to their successors their privilege nor
> without leaving in men’s minds imprints which are cumulative in their
> effect. The succession of governments which, in the course of
> centuries, rule the same society may be looked on as one underlying
> government which takes on continuous
> accretions.^[9](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn9)^

Another potent ideological force is for the State to deprecate the
*individual* and exalt either the past or the present collectivity of
society. Any isolated voice, any raiser of new doubts, can then be
attacked as a profane violator of the wisdom of his ancestors. Moreover,
any new idea, much less any new *critical* idea, must necessarily
*begin* as a small minority opinion. Therefore, in order to ward off any
potentially dangerous idea from threatening majority acceptance of its
rule, the State will try to nip the new idea in the bud by ridiculing
any view that sets itself against mass opinion. The ways in which the
State rulers in ancient Chinese despotisms used religion as a method of
binding the individual to the State-run society were summarized by
Norman Jacobs:

> Chinese religion is a social religion, seeking to solve the problems
> of social interests, not individual interests. ... Religion is
> essentially a force of impersonal social adjustment and control—rather
> than a medium for the personal solutions of the individual—and social
> adjustment and control are effected through education and reverence
> for superiors. ... Reverence for superiors—superior in age and hence
> in education and experience—is the ethical foundation of social
> adjustment and control. ... In China, the interrelationship of
> political authority with orthodox religion equated heterodoxy with
> political error. The orthodox religion was particularly active in
> persecuting and destroying heterodox sects; in this it was backed by
> the secular power.^[10](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn10)^

The general tendency of government to seek out and thwart any heterodox
views was outlined, in typically witty and delightful style, by the
libertarian writer H.L. Mencken:

> All \[that government\] can see in an original idea is potential
> change, and hence an invasion of its prerogatives. The most dangerous
> man, to any government, is the man who is able to think things out for
> himself, without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos.
> Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he
> lives under is dishonest, insane and intolerable, and so, if he is
> romantic, he tries to change it. And even if he is not romantic
> personally he is very apt to spread discontent among those who
> are.^[11](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn11)^

It is also particularly important for the State to make its rule seem
*inevitable*: even if its reign is disliked, as it often is, it will
then be met with the passive resignation expressed in the familiar
coupling of “death and taxes.” One method is to bring to its side
historical determinism: if X-State rules us, then this has been
inevitably decreed for us by the Inexorable Laws of History (or the
Divine Will, or the Absolute, or the Material Productive Forces), and
nothing that any puny individuals may do can change the inevitable. It
is also important for the State to inculcate in its subjects an aversion
to any outcropping of what is now called “a conspiracy theory of
history.” For a search for “conspiracies,” as misguided as the results
often are, means a search for motives, and an attribution of individual
responsibility for the historical misdeeds of ruling elites. If,
however, any tyranny or venality or aggressive war imposed by the State
was brought about *not* by particular State rulers but by mysterious and
arcane “social forces,” or by the imperfect state of the world—or if, in
some way, *everyone* was guilty (“We are *all* murderers,” proclaims a
common slogan), then there is no point in anyone’s becoming indignant or
rising up against such misdeeds. Furthermore, a discrediting of
“conspiracy theories”—or indeed, of anything smacking of “economic
determinism”—will make the subjects more likely to believe the “general
welfare” reasons that are invariably put forth by the modern State for
engaging in any aggressive actions.

The rule of the State is thus made to seem inevitable. Furthermore, any
alternative to the existing State is encased in an aura of fear.
Neglecting its own monopoly of theft and predation, the State raises the
spectre among its subjects of the chaos that would supposedly ensue if
the State should disappear. The people on their own, it is maintained,
could not possibly supply their own protection against sporadic
criminals and marauders. Furthermore, each State has been particularly
successful over the centuries in instilling fear among its subjects of
*other* State rulers. With the land area of the globe now parcelled out
among particular States, one of the basic doctrines and tactics of the
rulers of each State has been to identify *itself* with the territory it
governs. Since most men tend to love their homeland, the identification
of that land and its population with the State is a means of making
natural patriotism work to the State’s advantage. If, then, “Ruritania”
is attacked by “Walldavia,” the first task of the Ruritanian State and
its intellectuals is to convince the people of Ruritania that the attack
is really upon *them*, and not simply upon their ruling class. In this
way, a war between *rulers* is converted into a war between *peoples,*
with each people rushing to the defense of their rulers in the mistaken
belief that the rulers are busily defending *them.* This device of
nationalism has been particularly successful in recent centuries; it was
not very long ago, at least in Western Europe, when the mass of subjects
regarded wars as irrelevant battles between various sets of nobles and
their retinues.

Another tried and true method for bending subjects to one’s will is the
infusion of guilt. Any increase in private well-being can be attacked as
“unconscionable greed,” “materialism,” or “excessive affluence”; and
mutually beneficial exchanges in the market can be denounced as
“selfish.” Somehow the conclusion always drawn is that more resources
should be expropriated from the private sector and siphoned into the
parasitic “public,” or State, sector. Often the call upon the public to
yield more resources is couched in a stern call by the ruling elite for
more “sacrifices” for the national or the common weal. Somehow, however,
while the public is supposed to sacrifice and curtail its “materialistic
greed,” the sacrifices are always one way. The *State* does not
sacrifice; the State eagerly grabs more and more of the public’s
material resources. Indeed, it is a useful rule of thumb: when your
ruler calls aloud for “sacrifices,” look to your own life and
pocket-book!

This sort of argumentation reflects a general double standard of
morality that is always applied to State rulers but not to anyone else.
No one, for example, is surprised or horrified to learn that businessmen
are seeking higher profits. No one is horrified if workers leave
lower-paying for higher-paying jobs. All this is considered proper and
normal behavior. But if anyone should dare assert that politicians and
bureaucrats are motivated by the desire to maximize *their* incomes, the
hue and cry of “conspiracy theorist” or “economic determinist” spreads
throughout the land. The general opinion—carefully cultivated, of
course, by the State itself—is that men enter politics or government
purely out of devoted concern for the common good and the public weal.
What gives the gentlemen of the State apparatus their superior moral
patina? Perhaps it is the dim and instinctive knowledge of the populace
that the State *is* engaged in systematic theft and predation, and they
may feel that only a dedication to altruism on the part of the State
makes these actions tolerable. To consider politicians and bureaucrats
subject to the same monetary aims as everyone else would strip the Robin
Hood veil from State predation. For it would then be clear that, in the
Oppenheimer phrasing, ordinary citizens were pursuing the peaceful,
productive “economic means” to wealth, while the State apparatus was
devoting itself to the coercive and exploitative organized “political
means.” The emperor’s clothes of supposed altruistic concern for the
common weal would then be stripped from him.

The intellectual arguments used by the State throughout history to
“engineer consent” by the public can be classified into two parts: (1)
that rule by the existing government is inevitable, absolutely
necessary, and far better than the indescribable evils that would ensue
upon its downfall; and (2) that the State rulers are especially great,
wise, and altruistic men—far greater, wiser, and better than their
simple subjects. In former times, the latter argument took the form of
rule by “divine right” or by the “divine ruler” himself, or by an
“aristocracy” of men. In modern times, as we indicated earlier, this
argument stresses not so much divine approval as rule by a wise guild of
“scientific experts” especially endowed in knowledge of statesmanship
and the arcane facts of the world. The increasing use of scientific
jargon, especially in the social sciences, has permitted intellectuals
to weave apologia for State rule which rival the ancient priestcraft in
obscurantism. For example, a thief who presumed to justify his theft by
saying that he was really helping his victims by his spending, thus
giving retail trade a needed boost, would be hooted down without delay.
But when this same theory is clothed in Keynesian mathematical equations
and impressive references to the “multiplier effect,” it carries far
more conviction with a bamboozled public.

In recent years, we have seen the development in the United States of a
profession of “national security managers,” of bureaucrats who never
face electoral procedures, but who continue, through administration
after administration, secretly using their supposed special expertise to
plan wars, interventions, and military adventures. Only their egregious
blunders in the Vietnam war have called their activities into any sort
of public question; before that, they were able to ride high, wide, and
handsome over the public they saw mostly as cannon fodder for their own
purposes.

A public debate between “isolationist” Senator Robert A. Taft and one of
the leading national security intellectuals, McGeorge Bundy, was
instructive in demarking both the issues at stake and the attitude of
the intellectual ruling elite. Bundy attacked Taft in early 1951 for
opening a public debate on the waging of the Korean war. Bundy insisted
that only the executive policy leaders were equipped to manipulate
diplomatic and military force in a lengthy decades-long period of
limited war against the communist nations. It was important, Bundy
maintained, that public opinion and public debate be excluded from
promulgating any policy role in this area. For, he warned, the public
was unfortunately not committed to the rigid national purposes discerned
by the policy managers; it merely responded to the *ad hoc* realities of
given situations. Bundy also maintained that there should be no
recriminations or even examinations of the decisions of the policy
managers, because it was important that the public accept their
decisions without question. Taft, in contrast, denounced the secret
decision-making by military advisers and specialists in the executive
branch, decisions effectively sealed off from public scrutiny.
Furthermore, he complained, “If anyone dared to suggest criticism or
even a thorough debate, he was at once branded as an isolationist and a
saboteur of unity and the bipartisan foreign
policy.”^[12](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn12)^

Similarly, at a time when President Eisenhower and Secretary of State
Dulles were privately contemplating going to war in Indochina, another
prominent national security manager, George F. Kennan, was advising the
public that “There are times when, having elected a government, we will
be best advised to let it govern and let it speak for us as it will in
the councils of the nations.”^[13](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn13)^

We see clearly why the State needs the intellectuals; but why do the
intellectuals need the State? Put simply, the intellectual’s livelihood
in the free market is generally none too secure; for the intellectual,
like everyone else on the market, must depend on the values and choices
of the masses of his fellow men, and it is characteristic of these
masses that they are generally uninterested in intellectual concerns.
The State, on the other hand, is willing to offer the intellectuals a
warm, secure, and permanent berth in its apparatus, a secure income, and
the panoply of prestige.

The eager alliance between the State and the intellectuals was
symbolized by the avid desire of the professors at the University of
Berlin, in the nineteenth century, to form themselves into what they
themselves proclaimed as the “intellectual bodyguard of the House of
Hohenzollern.” From a superficially different ideological perspective,
it can be seen in the revealingly outraged reaction of the eminent
Marxist scholar of ancient China, Joseph Needham, to Karl Wittfogel’s
acidulous critique of ancient Chinese despotism. Wittfogel had shown the
importance for bolstering the system of the Confucian glorification of
the gentleman-scholar officials who manned the ruling bureaucracy of
despotic China. Needham charged indignantly that the “civilization which
Professor Wittfogel is so bitterly attacking was one which could make
poets and scholars into officials.”^[14](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn14)^
What matter the totalitarianism so long as the ruling class is
abundantly staffed by certified intellectuals!

The worshipful and fawning attitude of intellectuals toward their rulers
has been illustrated many times throughout history. A contemporary
American counterpart to the “intellectual bodyguard of the House of
Hohenzollern” is the attitude of so many liberal intellectuals toward
the office and person of the President. Thus, to political scientist
Professor Richard Neustadt, the President is the “sole crown-like symbol
of the Union.” And policy manager Townsend Hoopes, in the winter of
1960, wrote that “under our system the people can look only to the
President to define the nature of our foreign policy problem and the
national programs and sacrifices required to meet it with
effectiveness.”^[15](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn15)^ After generations of
such rhetoric, it is no wonder that Richard Nixon, on the eve of his
election as President, should thus describe his role: “He \[the
President\] must articulate the nation’s values, define its goals and
marshall its will.” Nixon’s conception of his role is hauntingly similar
to Ernst Huber’s articulation, in the Germany of the 1930s, of the
*Constitutional Law of the Greater German Reich*. Huber wrote that the
head of State “sets up the great ends which are to be attained and draws
up the plans for the utilization of all national powers in the
achievement of the common goals... he gives the national life its true
purpose and value.”^[16](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn16)^

The attitude and motivation of the contemporary national security
intellectual bodyguard of the State has been caustically described by
Marcus Raskin, who was a staff member of the National Security Council
during the Kennedy administration. Calling them “megadeath
intellectuals,” Raskin writes that:

> their most important function is to justify and extend the existence
> of their employers. ... In order to justify the continued large-scale
> production of these \[thermonuclear\] bombs and missiles, military and
> industrial leaders needed some kind of theory to rationalize their

This is not to say that all intellectuals everywhere have been “court
intellectuals,” servitors and junior partners of power. But this has
been the ruling condition in the history of civilizations—generally in
the form of a priestcraft—just as the ruling condition in those
civilizations has been one or another form of despotism. There have been
glorious exceptions, however, particularly in the history of Western
civilization, where intellectuals have often been trenchant critics and
opponents of State power, and have used their intellectual gifts to
fashion theoretical systems which could be used in the struggle for
liberation from that power. But invariably, these intellectuals have
only been able to arise as a significant force when they have been able
to operate from an independent power base—an independent property
base—separate from the apparatus of the State. For wherever the State
controls all property, wealth, and employment, everyone is economically
dependent on it, and it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for such
independent criticism to arise. It has been in the West, with its
decentralized foci of power, its independent sources of property and
employment, and therefore of bases from which to criticize the State,
where a body of intellectual critics has been able to flourish. In the
Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church, which was at least separate if
not independent from the State, and the new free towns were able to
serve as centers of intellectual and also of substantive opposition. In
later centuries, teachers, ministers, and pamphleteers in a relatively
free society were able to use their independence from the State to
agitate for further expansion of freedom. In contrast, one of the first
libertarian philosophers, Lao-tse, living in the midst of ancient
Chinese despotism, saw no hope for achieving liberty in that
totalitarian society except by counseling quietism, to the point of the
individual’s dropping out of social life altogether.

With decentralized power, with a Church separate from the State, with
flourishing towns and cities able to develop outside the feudal power
structure, and with freedom in society, the economy was able to develop
in Western Europe in a way that transcended all previous civilizations.
Furthermore, the Germanic—and particularly the Celtic—tribal structure
which succeeded the disintegrating Roman Empire had strong libertarian
elements. Instead of a mighty State apparatus exerting a monopoly of
violence, disputes were solved by contending tribesmen consulting the
elders of the tribe on the nature and application of the tribe’s
customary and common law. The “chief” was generally merely a war leader
who was only called into his warrior role whenever war with other tribes
was under way. There was no permanent war or military bureaucracy in the
tribes. In Western Europe, as in many other civilizations, the typical
model of the origin of the State was not via a voluntary “social
contract” but by the conquest of one tribe by another. The original
liberty of the tribe or the peasantry thus falls victim to the
conquerors. At first, the conquering tribe killed and looted the victims
and rode on. But at some time the conquerors decided that it would be
more profitable to settle down among the conquered peasantry and rule
and loot them on a permanent and systematic basis. The periodic tribute
exacted from the conquered subjects eventually came to be called
“taxation.” And, with equal generality, the conquering chieftains
parcelled out the land of the peasantry to the various warlords, who
were then able to settle down and collect feudal “rent” from the
peasantry. The peasants were often enslaved, or rather enserfed, to the
land itself to provide a continuing source of exploited labor for the
feudal lords.^[18](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn18)^

We may note a few prominent instances of the birth of a modern State
through conquest. One was the military conquest of the Indian peasantry
in Latin America by the Spaniards. The conquering Spanish not only
established a new State over the Indians, but the land of the peasantry
was parcelled out among the conquering warlords, who were ever after to
collect rent from the tillers of the land. Another instance was the new
political form imposed upon the Saxons of England after their conquest
by the Normans in 1066. The land of England was parcelled out among the
Norman warrior lords, who thereby formed a State and feudal-land
apparatus of rule over the subject population. For the libertarian, the
most interesting and certainly the most poignant example of the creation
of a State through conquest was the destruction of the libertarian
society of ancient Ireland by England in the seventeenth century, a
conquest which established an imperial State and ejected numerous Irish
from their cherished land. The libertarian society of Ireland, which
lasted for a thousand years—and which will be described further
below—was able to resist English conquest for hundreds of years because
of the absence of a State which could be conquered easily and then used
by the conquerors to rule over the native population.

But while throughout Western history, intellectuals have formulated
theories designed to check and *limit* State power, each State has been
able to use its own intellectuals to turn those ideas around into
further legitimations of its own advance of power. Thus, originally, in
Western Europe the concept of the “divine right of kings” was a doctrine
promoted by the Church to limit State power. The idea was that the king
could not just impose his arbitrary will. His edicts were limited to
conforming with the divine law. As absolute monarchy advanced, however,
the kings were able to turn the concept around to the idea that God put
his stamp of approval on any of the king’s actions; that he ruled by
“divine right.”

Similarly, the concept of parliamentary democracy began as a popular
check on the absolute rule of the monarch. The king was limited by the
power of parliament to grant him tax revenues. Gradually, however, as
parliament displaced the king as head of State, the parliament itself
became the unchecked State sovereign. In the early nineteenth century,
English utilitarians, who advocated additional individual liberty in the
name of social utility and the general welfare, were to see these
concepts turned into sanctions for expanding the power of the State.

Certainly, the most ambitious attempt in history to impose limits on the
State was the Bill of Rights and other restrictive parts of the United
States Constitution. Here, written limits on government became the
fundamental law, to be interpreted by a judiciary supposedly independent
of the other branches of government. All Americans are familiar with the
process by which John C. Calhoun’s prophetic analysis has been
vindicated; the State’s own monopoly judiciary has inexorably broadened
the construction of State power over the last century and a half. But
few have been as keen as liberal Professor Charles Black—who hails the
process—in seeing that the State has been able to transform judicial
review itself from a limiting device into a powerful instrument for
gaining legitimacy for its actions in the minds of the public. If a
judicial decree of “unconstitutional” is a mighty check on governmental
power, so too a verdict of “constitutional” is an equally mighty weapon
for fostering public acceptance of ever greater governmental power.

Professor Black begins his analysis by pointing out the crucial
necessity for “legitimacy” of any government in order to endure; that
is, basic majority acceptance of the government and its actions.
Acceptance of legitimacy, however, becomes a real problem in a country
like the United States, where “substantive limitations are built into
the theory on which the government rests.” What is needed, adds Black,
is a method by which the government can assure the public that its
expanding powers are indeed “constitutional.” And this, he concludes,
has been the major historic function of judicial review. Let Black
illustrate the problem:

This danger is averted, Black adds, by the State’s propounding the
doctrine that *some one* agency must have the ultimate decision on
constitutionality, and that this agency must be part of the federal
government itself. For while the seeming independence of the federal
judiciary has played a vital role in making its actions virtual Holy
Writ for the bulk of the population, it is also true that the judiciary
is part and parcel of the government apparatus and is appointed by the
executive and legislative branches. Professor Black concedes that the
government has thereby set itself up as a judge in its own case, and has
thus violated a basic juridical principle for arriving at any kind of
just decision. But Black is remarkably lighthearted about this
fundamental breach: “The final power of the State... must stop where the
law stops it. And who shall set the limit, and who shall enforce the
stopping, against the mightiest power? Why, the State itself, of course,
through its judges and its laws. Who controls the temperate? Who teaches
the wise?”^[21](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn21)^ And so Black admits that
when we have a State, we hand over all our weapons and means of coercion
to the State apparatus, we turn over all of our powers of ultimate
decision-making to this deified group, and *then* we must jolly well sit
back quietly and await the unending stream of justice that will pour
forth from these institutions—even though they are basically judging
their own case. Black sees no conceivable alternative to this coercive
monopoly of judicial decisions enforced by the State, but here is
precisely where our new movement challenges this conventional view and
asserts that there *is* a viable alternative: libertarianism.

Seeing no such alternative, Professor Black falls back on mysticism in
his defense of the State, for in the final analysis he finds the
achievement of justice and legitimacy from the State’s perpetual judging
of its own cause to be “something of a miracle.” In this way, the
liberal Black joins the conservative Burnham in falling back on the
miraculous and thereby admitting that there is no satisfactory rational
argument in support of the State.^[22](#24-notes.html#chap03_fn22)^

Applying his realistic view of the Supreme Court to the famous conflict
between the Court and the New Deal in the 1930s, Professor Black chides
his liberal colleagues for their shortsightedness in denouncing judicial
obstructionism:

> the standard version of the story of the New Deal and the Court,

In this way, the Supreme Court was able to put the quietus to the large
body of Americans who had strong constitutional objections to the
expanded powers of the New Deal:

Thus, even in the United States, unique among governments in having a
constitution, parts of which at least were meant to impose strict and
solemn limits upon its actions, even here the Constitution has proved to
be an instrument for ratifying the expansion of State power rather than
the opposite. As Calhoun saw, any written limits that leave it to
government to interpret its own powers are bound to be interpreted as
sanctions for expanding and not binding those powers. In a profound
sense, the idea of binding down power with the chains of a written
constitution has proved to be a noble experiment that failed. The idea
of a strictly limited government has proved to be utopian; some other,
more radical means must be found to prevent the growth of the aggressive
State. The libertarian system would meet this problem by scrapping the
entire notion of creating a government—an institution with a coercive
monopoly of force over a given territory—and *then* hoping to find ways
to keep that government from expanding. The libertarian alternative is
to abstain from such a monopoly government to begin with.

We will explore the entire notion of a State-less society, a society
without formal government, in later chapters. But one instructive
exercise is to try to abandon the habitual ways of seeing things, and to
consider the argument for the State *de novo.* Let us try to transcend
the fact that for as long as we can remember, the State has monopolized
police and judicial services in society. Suppose that we were all
starting completely from scratch, and that millions of us had been
dropped down upon the earth, fully grown and developed, from some other
planet. Debate begins as to how protection (police and judicial
services) will be provided. Someone says: “Let’s all give all of our
weapons to Joe Jones over there, and to his relatives. And let Jones and
his family decide all disputes among us. In that way, the Joneses will
be able to protect all of us from any aggression or fraud that anyone
else may commit. With all the power and all the ability to make ultimate
decisions on disputes in the hands of Jones, we will all be protected
from one another. And then let us allow the Joneses to obtain their
income from this great service by using their weapons, and by exacting
as much revenue by coercion as they shall desire.” Surely in that sort
of situation, no one would treat this proposal with anything but
ridicule. For it would be starkly evident that there would be no way, in
that case, for any of us to protect ourselves from the aggressions, or
the depredations, of the Joneses themselves. No one would then have the
total folly to respond to that long-standing and most perceptive query:
“Who shall guard the guardians?” by answering with Professor Black’s
blithe: “Who controls the temperate?” It is only because we have become
accustomed over thousands of years to the existence of the State that we
now give precisely this kind of absurd answer to the problem of social
protection and defense.

And, of course, the State never really did begin with this sort of
“social contract.” As Oppenheimer pointed out, the State generally began
in violence and conquest; even if at times internal processes gave rise
to the State, it was certainly never by general consensus or contract.

The libertarian creed can now be summed up as (1) the absolute right of
every man to the ownership of his own body; (2) the equally absolute
right to own and therefore to control the material resources he has
found and transformed; and (3) therefore, the absolute right to exchange
or give away the ownership to such titles to whoever is willing to
exchange or receive them. As we have seen, each of these steps involves
*property* rights, but even if we call step (1) “personal” rights, we
shall see that problems about “personal liberty” inextricably involve
the rights of material property or free exchange. Or, briefly, the
rights of personal liberty and “freedom of enterprise” almost invariably
intertwine and cannot really be separated.

We have seen that the exercise of personal “freedom of speech,” for
example, almost invariably involves the exercise of “economic
freedom”—i.e., freedom to own and exchange material property. The
holding of a meeting to exercise freedom of speech involves the hiring
of a hall, traveling to the hall over roads, and using some form of
transportation, etc. The closely related “freedom of the press” even
more evidently involves the cost of printing and of using a press, the
sale of leaflets to willing buyers—in short, all the ingredients of
“economic freedom.” Furthermore, our example of “shouting ‘fire’ in a
crowded theater” provides us with the clear guideline for deciding
*whose* rights must be defended in any given situation—the guidelines
being provided by our criterion: the rights of property.
