## PUBLIC AND COMPULSORY SCHOOLING [public-and-compulsory-schooling]

Until the last few years there were few institutions in America that
were held more sacred—especially by liberals—than the public school.
Devotion to the public school had seized even those early Americans—such
as Jeffersonians and Jacksonians—who were libertarian in most other
respects. In recent years the public school was supposed to be a crucial
ingredient of democracy, the fount of brotherhood, and the enemy of
elitism and separateness in American life. The public school was the
embodiment of the alleged right of every child to an education, and it
was upheld as a crucible of understanding and harmony between men of all
occupations and social classes who would rub elbows from an early age
with all their neighbors.

Going hand in hand with the spread of public education have been
*compulsory attendance laws*, which have forced all children up to a
high—and continually increasing—minimum age, to attend either a public
school or a private school certified as suitable by the state apparatus.
In contrast to earlier decades, when a relatively small proportion of
the population went to school in the higher grades, the entire mass of
the population has thus been coerced by the government into spending a
large portion of the most impressionable years of their lives in public
institutions. We could easily have analyzed compulsory attendance laws
in our chapter on involuntary servitude, for what institution is more
evidently a vast system of incarceration? In recent years, Paul Goodman
and other critics of education have trenchantly exposed the nation’s
public schools—and to a lesser extent their private appendages—as a vast
prison system for the nation’s youth, dragooning countless millions of
unwilling and unadaptable children into the schooling structure. The New
Left tactic of breaking into the high schools shouting “Jailbreak!” may
have been absurd and ineffective, but it certainly expressed a great
truth about the school system. For if we are to dragoon the entire youth
population into vast prisons in the guise of “education,” with teachers
and administrators serving as surrogate wardens and guards, why should
we not expect vast unhappiness, discontent, alienation, and rebellion on
the part of the nation’s youth? The only surprise should be that the
rebellion was so long in coming. But now it is increasingly acknowledged
that something is terribly wrong with America’s proudest institution;
that, especially in urban areas, the public schools have become
cesspools of crime, petty theft, and drug addiction, and that little or
no genuine education takes place amidst the warping of the minds and
souls of the children.^[1](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn1)^

Part of the reason for this tyranny over the nation’s youth is misplaced
altruism on the part of the educated middle class. The workers, or the
“lower classes,” they felt, should have the opportunity to enjoy the
schooling the middle classes value so highly. And if the parents or the
children of the masses should be so benighted as to balk at this
glorious opportunity set before them, well, then, a little coercion must
be applied—”for their own good,” of course.

A crucial fallacy of the middle-class school worshippers is confusion
between formal schooling and *education* in general. Education is a
lifelong process of learning, and learning takes place not only in
school, but in all areas of life. When the child plays, or listens to
parents or friends, or reads a newspaper, or works at a job, he or she
is becoming *educated.* Formal schooling is only a small part of the
educational process, and is really only suitable for formal subjects of
instruction, particularly in the more advanced and systematic subjects.
The elementary subjects, reading, writing, arithmetic and their
corollaries, can easily be learned at home and outside the school.

Furthermore, one of the great glories of mankind is its diversity, the
fact that each individual is unique, with unique abilities, interests,
and aptitudes. To coerce into formal schooling children who have neither
the ability nor the interest in this area is a criminal warping of the
soul and mind of the child. Paul Goodman has raised the cry that most
children would be far better off if they were allowed to work at an
early age, learn a trade, and begin to do that which they are most
suited for. America was built by citizens and leaders, many of whom
received little or no formal schooling, and the idea that one must have
a high-school diploma—or nowadays, an A.B. degree—before he can begin to
work and to live in the world is an absurdity of the current age.
Abolish compulsory attendance laws and give children their head, and we
will return to a nation of people far more productive, interested,
creative, and happy. Many thoughtful opponents of the New Left and the
youth rebellion have pointed out that much of the discontent of youth
and their divorce from reality is due to the ever-longer period in which
youth must remain at school, wrapped in a cocoon of dependence and
irresponsibility. Well and good, but what is the main reason for this
ever-lengthening cocoon? Clearly the whole system, and in particular the
compulsory attendance laws, which preach that everyone must go
perpetually to school—first to high school, now to college, and soon
perhaps for a Ph.D. degree. It is the compulsion toward mass schooling
that creates both the discontent and the ever-continuing shelter from
the “real world.” In no other nation and in no other age has this mania
for mass schooling so taken hold.

It is remarkable that the old libertarian right and the New Left, from
very different perspectives and using very different rhetoric, came to a
similar perception of the despotic nature of mass schooling. Thus,
Albert Jay Nock, the great individualist theorist of the 1920s and ’30s,
denounced the educational system for forcing the “ineducable” masses
into the schools out of a vain egalitarian belief in the equal
educability of every child. Instead of allowing those children with the
needed aptitude and ability to go to school, all children are being
coerced into schools for their own supposed good, and the result is a
distortion of the lives of those not suited for school and the wrecking
of proper schooling for the truly educable. Nock also perceptively
criticized the conservatives who attacked “progressive education” for
diluting educational standards by giving courses in automobile driving,
basket weaving, or choosing a dentist. Nock pointed out that if you
force a whole host of children who cannot absorb classical education
into school, then you *have* to shift education in the direction of
vocational training, suitable for the lowest common denominator. The
fatal flaw is not progressive education, but the drive toward universal
schooling to which progressivism was a makeshift
response.^[2](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn2)^

Such New Left critics as John McDermott and Paul Goodman charge, for
their part, that the middle class has been forcing working class
children, many of them with completely different values and aptitudes,
into a public school system designed to force these children into a
middle-class mould. It should be clear that whether one favors one class
or the other, one ideal of schooling or another, the substance of the
criticism is very much the same: that a whole mass of children are being
dragooned into an institution for which they have little interest or
aptitude.

Indeed, if we look into the history of the drive for public schooling
and compulsory attendance in this and other countries, we find at the
root not so much misguided altruism as a conscious scheme to coerce the
mass of the population into a mould desired by the Establishment.
Recalcitrant minorities were to be forced into a majority mould; all
citizens were to be inculcated in the civic virtues, notably and always
including obedience to the State apparatus. Indeed, if the mass of the
populace is to be educated in government schools, how could these
schools *not* become a mighty instrument for the inculcation of
obedience to the State authorities? Martin Luther, a leader in the first
modern drive for compulsory State education, phrased the plea typically
in his famous letter of 1524 to the rulers of Germany:

> Dear rulers... I maintain that the civil authorities are under
> obligation to compel the people to send their children to school. ...
> If the government can compel such citizens as are fit for military
> service to bear spear and rifle, to mount ramparts, and perform other
> martial duties in time of war, how much more has it a right to the
> people to send their children to school, because in this case we are
> warring with the devil, whose object it is secretly to exhaust our
> cities and principalities.^[3](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn3)^

Thus, for Luther, the State schools were to be an indispensable part of
the “war with the devil,” i.e., with Catholics, Jews, infidels, and
competing Protestant sects. A modern admirer of Luther and of compulsory
education was to remark that

> the permanent and positive value of Luther’s pronouncement of 1524
> lies... in the hallowed associations which it established for
> Protestant Germany between the national religion and the educational
> duties of the individual and the state. Thus, doubtless, was created
> that healthy public opinion which rendered the principle of compulsory
> school attendance easy of acceptance in Prussia at a much earlier date
> than in England.^[4](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn4)^

The other great Protestant founder, John Calvin, was no less zealous in
promoting mass public schooling, and for similar reasons. It is
therefore not surprising that the earliest compulsory schooling in
America was established by the Calvinist Puritans in Massachusetts Bay,
those men who were so eager to plant an absolutist Calvinist theocracy
in the New World. In June 1642, only a year after the Massachusetts Bay
colony enacted its first set of laws, the colony established the first
system of compulsory education in the English-speaking world. The law
declared:

> For as much as the good education of children is of singular behoof
> and benefit to any commonwealth, and whereas many parents and masters
> are too indulgent and negligent of their duty of that kind, it is
> ordered that the selectmen of every town... shall have a vigilant eye
> over their neighbors, to see first that none of them shall suffer so
> much barbarism in any of their families, as not to endeavor to teach,
> by themselves or others, their children and
> apprentices.^[5](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn5)^

Five years later, Massachusetts Bay followed up this law with the
establishment of public schools.

Thus, from the beginning of American history, the desire to mould,
instruct, and render obedient the mass of the population was the major
impetus behind the drive toward public schooling. In colonial days,
public schooling was used as a device to suppress religious dissent, as
well as to imbue unruly servants with the virtues of obedience to the
State. It is typical, for example, that in the course of their
suppression of the Quakers, Massachusetts and Connecticut forbade that
despised sect from establishing their own schools. And Connecticut, in a
vain attempt to suppress the “New Light” movement, in 1742 forbade that
sect from establishing any of their own schools. Otherwise, the
Connecticut authorities reasoned, the New Lights “may tend to train
youth in ill principles and practices, and introduce such disorders as
may be of fatal consequences to the public peace and weal of this
colony.”^[6](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn6)^ It is hardly a coincidence that
the only truly free colony in New England—Rhode Island—was also the one
colony in the area devoid of public schooling.

The motivation for public and compulsory schooling after Independence
scarcely differed in essentials. Thus, Archibald D. Murphey, the father
of the public school system in North Carolina, called for such schools
as follows:

> all the children will be taught in them. ... In these schools the
> precepts of morality and religion should be inculcated, and habits of
> subordination and obedience be formed. ... Their parents know not how
> to instruct them. ... The state, in the warmth of her affection and
> solicitude for their welfare, must take charge of those children, and
> place them in school where their minds can be enlightened and their
> hearts can be trained to virtue.^[7](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn7)^

One of the most common uses of compulsory public schooling has been to
oppress and cripple national ethnic and linguistic minorities or
colonized peoples—to force them to abandon their own language and
culture on behalf of the language and culture of the ruling groups. The
English in Ireland and Quebec, and nations throughout Central and
Eastern Europe and in Asia—all dragooned their national minorities into
the public schools run by their masters. One of the most potent stimuli
for discontent and rebellion by these oppressed peoples was the desire
to rescue their language and heritage from the weapon of public schools
wielded by their oppressors. Thus, the laissez-faire liberal Ludwig von
Mises has written that, in linguistically mixed countries,

> continued adherence to a policy of compulsory education is utterly
> incompatible with efforts to establish lasting peace. The question of
> which language is to be made the basis of instruction assumes crucial
> importance. A decision one way or the other can, over the years,
> determine the nationality of a whole area. The school can alienate
> children from the nationality to which their parents belong and can be
> used as a means of oppressing whole nationalities. Whoever controls
> the schools has the power to injure other nationalities and to benefit
> his own.

Furthermore, Mises points out, the coercion inherent in rule by one
nationality makes it impossible to solve the problem by formally
allowing each parent to send his child to a school using a language of
his own nationality.

> It is often not possible for an individual—out of regard for his means
> of livelihood—to declare himself openly for one or another
> nationality. Under a system of interventionism, it could cost him the
> patronage of customers belonging to other nationalities or a job with
> an entrepreneur of a different nationality. ... If one leaves to the
> parents the choice of the school to which they wish to send their

> institutions.^[8](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn8)^

In fact, one of the major motivations of the legion of
mid-nineteenth-century American “educational reformers” who established
the modern public school system was precisely to use it to cripple the
cultural and linguistic life of the waves of immigrants into America,
and to mould them, as educational reformer Samuel Lewis stated, into
“one people.” It was the desire of the Anglo-Saxon majority to tame,
channel, and restructure the immigrants, and in particular to smash the
parochial school system of the Catholics, that formed the major impetus
for educational “reform.” The New Left critics who perceive the role of
the public schools of today in crippling and moulding the minds of
ghetto children are only grasping the current embodiment of a
long-cherished goal held by the public school Establishment—by the
Horace Manns and the Henry Barnards and the Calvin Stowes. It was Mann
and Barnard, for example, who urged the use of the schools for
indoctrination against the “mobocracy” of the Jacksonian movement. And
it was Stowe, author of an admiring tract on the Prussian compulsory
school system originally inspired by Martin Luther, who wrote of the
schools in unmistakably Lutheran and military terms:

> If a regard to the public safety makes it right for a government to
> compel the citizens to do military duty when the country is invaded,
> the same reason authorizes the government to compel them to provide
> for the education of their children. ... A man has no more right to
> endanger the state by throwing upon it a family of ignorant and
> vicious children, than he has to give admission to the spies of an
> invading army.^[9](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn9)^

Forty years later, Newton Bateman, a leading educator, spoke of the
State’s “right of eminent domain” over the “minds and souls and bodies”
of the nation’s children: Education, he asserted, “cannot be left to the
caprices and contingencies of
individuals.”^[10](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn10)^

The most ambitious attempt by the public school partisans to maximize
their control over the nation’s children came in Oregon during the early
1920s. The state of Oregon, unhappy even with allowing private schools
certified by the state, passed a law on November 7, 1922, outlawing
private schools and compelling all children to attend public school.
Here was the culmination of the educationists’ dream. At last, all
children were to be forced into the “democratizing” mould of uniform
education by the state authorities. The law, happily, was declared
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1925
(*Pierce v. Society of Sisters*, June 1, 1925). The Supreme Court
declared that “the child is not the mere creature of the State,” and
asserted that the Oregon law clashed with the “fundamental theory of
liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose.” The public
school fanatics never tried to go that far again. But it is instructive
to realize what the forces were that attempted to outlaw all competing
private education in the state of Oregon. For the spearheads of the law
were *not,* as we might expect, liberal or progressive educators or
intellectuals; the spearhead was the Ku Klux Klan, then strong in the
northern states, which was eager to crush the Catholic parochial school
system, and to force all Catholic and immigrant children into the
neo-Protestantizing and “Americanizing” force of the public school. The
Klan, it is interesting to note, opined that such a law was necessary
for the “preservation of free institutions.” It is well to ponder that
the much-vaunted “progressive” and “democratic” public school system had
its most ardent supporters in the most bigoted byways of American life,
among people anxious to stamp out diversity and variety in
America.^[11](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn11)^

## UNIFORMITY OR DIVERSITY? [uniformity-or-diversity]

While current educationists do not go as far as the Ku Klux Klan, it is
important to realize that the very *nature* of the public school
*requires* the imposition of uniformity and the stamping out of
diversity and individuality in education.

For it is in the nature of any governmental bureaucracy to live by a set
of rules, and to impose those rules in a uniform and heavy-handed
manner. If it did not do so, and the bureaucrat were to decide
individual cases ad hoc, he would then be accused, and properly so, of
not treating each taxpayer and citizen in an equal and uniform manner.
He would be accused of discrimination and of fostering special
privilege. Furthermore, it is administratively more convenient for the
bureaucrat to establish uniform rules throughout his jurisdiction. In
contrast to the private, profit-making business, the government
bureaucrat is neither interested in efficiency nor in serving his
customers to the best of his ability. Having no need to make profits and
sheltered from the possibility of suffering losses, the bureaucrat can
and does disregard the desires and demands of his consumer-customers.
His major interest is in “not making waves,” and this he accomplishes by
even-handedly applying a uniform set of rules, regardless of how
inapplicable they may be in any given case.

The public school bureaucrat, for his part, is faced with a host of
crucial and controversial decisions in deciding on the pattern of formal
schooling in his area. He must decide: Should schooling be—traditional
or progressive? free enterprise or socialistic? competitive or
egalitarian? liberal arts or vocational? segregated or integrated? sex
education or not? religious or secular? or various shades between these
poles. The point is that *whatever* he decides, and even if he decides
according to the wishes of the majority of the public, there will always
be a substantial number of parents and children who will be totally
deprived of the kind of education they desire. If the decision is for
traditional discipline in the schools, then the more progressive-minded
parents lose out, and vice versa; and the same is true for all the other
critical decisions. The more that education becomes public, the more
will parents and children be deprived of the education they feel they
need. The more that education becomes public, the more will heavy-handed
uniformity stamp out the needs and desires of individuals and
minorities.

Consequently, the greater the sphere of public as opposed to private
education, the greater the scope and intensity of conflict in social
life. For if one agency is going to make the decision: sex education or
no, traditional or progressive, integrated or segregated, etc., then it
becomes particularly important to gain control of the government and to
prevent one’s adversaries from taking power themselves. Hence, in
education as well as in all other activities, the more that government
decisions replace private decision-making, the more various groups will
be at each others’ throats in a desperate race to see to it that the one
and only decision in each vital area goes its own way.

Contrast the deprivation and intense social conflict inherent in
government decision-making with the state of affairs on the free market.
If education were strictly private, then each and every group of parents
could and would patronize its own kind of school. A host of diverse
schools would spring up to meet the varied structure of educational
demands by parents and children. Some schools would be traditional,
others progressive. Schools would range through the full
traditional-progressive scale; some schools would experiment with
egalitarian and gradeless education, others would stress the rigorous
learning of subjects and competitive grading; some schools would be
secular, others would emphasize various religious creeds; some schools
would be libertarian and stress the virtues of free enterprise, others
would preach various kinds of socialism.

Let us consider, for example, the structure of the magazine or book
publishing industry today, remembering too that magazines and books are
themselves an extremely important form of education. The magazine
market, being roughly free, contains all manner of magazines to suit a
wide variety of tastes and demands by consumers: there are nationwide,
all-purpose magazines; there are liberal, conservative, and all manner
of ideological journals; there are specialized scholarly publications;
and there are a myriad of magazines devoted to special interests and
hobbies like bridge, chess, hi-fi, etc. A similar structure appears in
the free book market: there are wide-circulation books, books appealing
to specialized markets, books of all ideological persuasions. Abolish
public schools, and the free, varied, and diverse magazine and book
markets would be paralleled by a similar kind of “school market.” In
contrast, if there were only one magazine for each city or state, think
of the battles and conflicts that would rage: Should the magazine be
conservative, liberal, or socialist; how much space should it devote to
fiction or bridge, etc.? The pressures and conflicts would be intense,
and no resolution would be satisfactory, for *any* decision would
deprive countless numbers of people of what they want and require. What
the libertarian is calling for, then, is not as *outré* as it might at
first appear; what he is calling for is a school system as free and
varied as most other educational media are today.

To focus again on other educational media, what then would we think of a
proposal for the government, federal or state, to use the taxpayers
money to set up a nationwide chain of public magazines or newspapers,
and then to compel all people, or all children, to read them? Further,
what would we think of the government outlawing all other newspapers and
magazines, or at the very least outlawing all newspapers or magazines
that do not come up to certain “standards” of what a government
commission thinks children ought to read? Such a proposal would surely
be regarded with horror throughout the country, yet this is precisely
the sort of regime that government has established in the schools. A
compulsory public press would rightly be considered an invasion of the
basic freedom of the press; is not scholastic freedom at least as
important as press freedom? Aren’t both vital media for public
information and education, for free inquiry and search for the truth? In
fact, the suppression of free schooling should be regarded with even
greater horror than the suppression of a free press, since here the
tender and unformed minds of children are more directly involved.

It is intriguing that at least some public school advocates have
recognized the analogy between schooling and the press and have pursued
their logic to the latter area. Thus, prominent in Boston politics in
the 1780s and 1790s was the arch-Federalist “Essex Junto,” a group of
leading merchants and lawyers originally hailing from Essex County,
Massachusetts. The Essexmen were particularly anxious for an extensive
public school system in order to have the youth “taught the proper
subordination.” Essexman Stephen Higginson frankly declared that “the
people must be taught to confide in and revere their rulers.” And seeing
with firm consistency that newspapers were as important a form of
education as formal schooling, another leading Essex merchant and
theoretician, Jonathan Jackson, denounced the free press for being
necessarily subservient to its readership, and advocated a state-owned
newspaper that could be independent of its readers and therefore
inculcate the proper virtues into the
citizenry.^[12](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn12)^

Professor E.G. West has also offered an instructive analogy between the
provision of schooling and of food, surely an industry of at least an
equal importance for children as well as adults. West writes:

> Protection of a child against starvation or malnutrition is presumably
> just as important as protection against ignorance. It is difficult to
> envisage, however, that any government, in its anxiety to see that
> children have minimum standards of food and clothing, would pass laws

> education.^[13](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn13)^

Several libertarian thinkers, from “left-” and “right”-wing ends of the
libertarian spectrum, have delivered trenchant critiques of the
totalitarian nature of compulsory public schooling. Thus,
left-libertarian British critic Herbert Read:

> Mankind is naturally differentiated into many types, and to press all
> these types into the same mold must inevitably lead to distortions and
> repressions. Schools should be of many kinds, following different
> methods and catering for different dispositions. It might be argued
> that even a totalitarian state must recognize this principle but the
> truth is that differentiation is an organic process, the spontaneous
> and roving associations of individuals for particular purposes. ...
> The whole structure of education as the natural process we have
> envisaged, falls to pieces if we attempt to make that structure...
> artificial.^[14](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn14)^

And the great late-nineteenth-century individualist English philosopher
Herbert Spencer asked:

> For what is meant by saying that a government ought to educate the
> people? Why should they be educated? What is the education for?
> Clearly to fit the people for social life—to make them good citizens?
> And who is to say what are good citizens? The government: there is no
> other judge. And who is to say how these good citizens may be made?
> The government: there is no other judge. Hence the proposition is
> convertible into this—a government ought to mold children into good
> citizens. ... It must first form for itself a definite conception of a

> pattern. This system of discipline it is bound to enforce to the
> uttermost. For if it does otherwise, it allows men to become different
> from what in its judgment they should become, and therefore fails in
> that duty it is charged to fulfill.^[15](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn15)^

And the twentieth-century American individualist writer Isabel Paterson
declared:

> Educational texts are necessarily selective, in subject matter,
> language, and point of view. Where teaching is conducted by private
> schools, there will be a considerable variation in different schools;
> the parents must judge what they want their children taught, by the

As E.C. West indicated, bureaucratic convenience has invariably led the
states to prescribe geographical public school districts, to place one
school in each district, and then to force each public school child to
attend school in the district closest to his residence. While in a free
private school market most children would undoubtedly attend schools
near their homes, the present system compels a monopoly of one school
per district, and thereby coerces uniformity throughout each area.
Children who, for whatever reason, would prefer to attend a school in
another district are prohibited from doing so. The result is enforced
geographic homogeneity, and it also means that the character of each
school is completely dependent on its residential neighborhood. It is
then inevitable that public schools, instead of being totally uniform,
will be uniform *within* each district, and the composition of pupils,
the financing of each school, and the quality of education will come to
depend upon the values, the wealth, and the tax base, of each
geographical area. The fact that wealthy school districts will have
costlier and higher-quality teaching, higher teaching salaries, and
better working conditions than the poorer districts, then becomes
inevitable. Teachers will regard the better schools as the superior
teaching posts, and the better teachers will gravitate to the better
school districts, while the poorer ones must remain in the lower-income
areas. Hence, the operation of district public schools inevitably
results in the negation of the very egalitarian goal which is supposed
to be a major aim of the public school system in the first place.

Moreover, if the residential areas are racially segregated, as they
often tend to be, the result of a compulsory geographical monopoly is
the compulsory racial segregation of the public schools. Those parents
who prefer integrated schooling have to come up against the geographical
monopoly system. Furthermore, just as some wag has said that nowadays
“Whatever isn’t prohibited is compulsory,” the recent tendency of the
public school bureaucrats has not been to institute voluntary busing of
children to widen parental discretion, but to swing in the opposite
direction and institute compulsory busing and compulsory racial
integration of the schools—often resulting in a grotesque transfer of
children far from their homes. Once again, the typical government
pattern: either compulsory segregation or compulsory integration. The
voluntary way—leaving the decisions up to the individual parents
involved—cuts across the grain of any State bureaucracy.

It is curious that recent movements for local parental control of public
education have sometimes been called “extreme right-wing” and at other
times “extreme left-wing,” when the libertarian motivation has been
precisely the same in either case. Thus, when parents have opposed the
compulsory busing of their children to distant schools, the educational
Establishment has condemned these movements as “bigoted” and
“right-wing.” But when, similarly, Negro parents—as in the case of Ocean
Hill-Brownsville in New York City—have demanded local parental control
of the school system, this drive in its turn has been condemned as
“extreme left-wing” and “nihilistic.” The most curious part of the
affair is that the parents in both cases have failed to recognize their
common desire for local parental control, and have themselves condemned
the “bigots” or “militants” in the other group. Tragically, neither the
local white nor black groups have recognized their common cause against
the educational Establishment: against dictatorial control of their
children’s education by an educational bureaucracy which is trying to
ram down their throats a form of schooling which *it* believes must be
imposed upon the recalcitrant masses. One crucial task of libertarians
is to highlight the common cause of all groups of parents against the
State’s educational tyranny. Of course, it must also be pointed out that
parents can *never* get the State off their educational backs until the
public school system is totally abolished and schooling becomes free
once more.

The geographical nature of the public school system has also led to a
coerced pattern of residential segregation, in income and consequently
in race, throughout the country and particularly in the suburbs. As
everyone knows, the United States since World War II has seen an
expansion of population, not in the inner central cities, but in the
surrounding suburban areas. As new and younger families have moved to
the suburbs, by far the largest and growing burden of local budgets has
been to pay for the public schools, which have to accommodate a young
population with a relatively high proportion of children per capita.
These schools invariably have been financed from growing property
taxation, which largely falls on the suburban residences. This means
that the wealthier the suburban family, and the more expensive its home,
the greater will be its tax contribution for the local school. Hence, as
the burden of school taxes increases steadily, the suburbanites try
desperately to encourage an inflow of wealthy residents and expensive
homes, and *to discourage* an inflow of poorer citizens. There is, in
short, a break-even point of the price of a house beyond which a new
family in a new house will more than pay for its children’s education in
its property taxes. Families in homes below that cost level will not pay
enough in property taxes to finance their children’s education and hence
will throw a greater tax burden on the existing population of the
suburb. Realizing this, suburbs have generally adopted rigorous zoning
laws which prohibit the erection of housing below a minimum cost
level—and thereby freeze out any inflow of poorer citizens. Since the
proportion of Negro poor is far greater than white poor, this
effectively also bars Negroes from joining the move to the suburbs. And
since in recent years there has been an increasing shift of jobs and
industry from the central city to the suburbs as well, the result is an
increasing pressure of unemployment on the Negroes—a pressure which is
bound to intensify as the job shift accelerates. The abolition of the
public schools, and therefore of the school burden—property tax linkage,
would go a long way toward removing zoning restrictions and ending the
suburb as an upper middle-class-white preserve.

## BURDENS AND SUBSIDIES [burdens-and-subsidies]

The very existence of the public school system, furthermore, involves a
complex network of coerced levies and subsidies, all of which are
difficult to justify on any ethical grounds whatever. In the first
place, public schools force those parents who wish to send their
children to private schools to shoulder a double burden: they are
coerced into subsidizing public school children, and they also have to
pay for their own children’s education. Only the evident breakdown of
public education in the large cities has maintained a flourishing
private school system there; in higher education, where the breakdown
has not been as stark, private colleges are rapidly being put out of
business by the competition from tax-subsidized free tuition and
tax-financed higher salaries. Similarly, since public schools must
constitutionally be secular, this means that religious parents must be
forced to subsidize the secular public schools. While “separation of
church and State” is a noble principle—and a subset of the libertarian
principle of separating *everything* from the State—it is surely going
too far in the other direction to force the religious to subsidize the
nonreligious through State coercion.

The existence of the public school also means that unmarried and
childless couples are coerced into subsidizing families with children.
What is the ethical principle here? And now that population growth is no
longer fashionable, consider the anomaly of liberal antipopulationists
advocating a public school system that not only subsidizes families with
children, but subsidizes them in *proportion to the number of children*
they have. We need not subscribe to the full dimensions of the current
antipopulation hysteria to question the wisdom of deliberately
subsidizing the number of children per family by government action. This
means, too, that poor single people and poor childless couples are
forced to subsidize wealthy families with children. Does this make any
ethical sense at all?

In recent years, the public school forces have promulgated the doctrine
that “Every child has a right to an education,” and therefore that the
taxpayers should be coerced into granting that right. But this concept
totally misconstrues the concept of “right.” A “right,” philosophically,
must be something embedded in the nature of man and reality, something
that can be preserved and maintained at any time and in any age. The
“right” of self-ownership, of defending one’s life and property, is
clearly that sort of right: it can apply to Neanderthal cavemen, in
modern Calcutta, or in the contemporary United States. Such a right is
independent of time or place. But a “right to a job” or to “three meals
a day” or to “twelve years of schooling” cannot be so guaranteed.
Suppose that such things *cannot* exist, as was true in Neanderthal days
or in modern Calcutta? To speak of a “right” as something which can only
be fulfilled in modern industrial conditions is not to speak of a human,
natural right at all. Furthermore, the libertarian “right” of
self-ownership does not require the coercion of one set of people to
provide such a “right” for another set. *Every* man can enjoy the right
of self-ownership, without special coercion upon anyone. But in the case
of a “right” to schooling, this can only be provided if other people are
coerced into fulfilling it. The “right” to schooling, to a job, three
meals, etc., is then not embedded in the nature of man, but requires for
its fulfillment the existence of a group of exploited people who are
coerced into providing such a “right.”

Furthermore the entire concept of a “right to education” should always
be placed in the context that formal schooling is only a small fraction
of any person’s education in life. If every child really has a “right”
to education, then why not a “right” to reading newspapers and
magazines, and then why should not the government tax everyone to
provide free public magazines for everyone who wishes to obtain them.

Professor Milton Friedman, an economist at the University of Chicago,
has performed an important service in separating out money sums from
various aspects of government subsidy, in education as well as in other
areas. While Friedman unfortunately accepts the view that every child
should have his schooling provided by the taxpayers, he points out the
*non sequitur* in using this as an argument for public schools: It is
quite feasible for the taxpayer to subsidize every child’s education
without having any public schools
whatsoever!^[17](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn17)^ In Friedman’s now famous
“voucher plan,” the government would give to every parent a voucher
entitling him to pay a certain amount of tuition for each child, in *any
school* of the parent’s choice. The voucher plan would continue the
tax-financed provision of education for every child, yet enable the
abolition of the vast monopolistic, inefficient, dictatorial public
school bureaucracy. The parent could then send his child to any sort of
private school that he wished, and the range of choice for every parent
and child would then be maximized. The child could then go to any type
of school—progressive or traditional, religious or secular, free
enterprise or socialistic—the parent desired. The monetary subsidy would
then be totally separated from the government’s actual provision of
schooling through a public school system.

While the Friedman plan would be a great improvement over the present
system in permitting a wider range of parental choice and enabling the
abolition of the public school system, the libertarian finds many grave
problems yet remaining. In the first place, the immorality of coerced
subsidy for schooling would still continue in force. Secondly, it is
inevitable that the power to subsidize brings with it the power to
regulate and control: The government is not about to hand out vouchers
for *any* kind of schooling whatever. Clearly, then, the government
would only pay vouchers for private schools *certified* as fitting and
proper by the State, which means detailed control of the private schools
by the government—control over their curriculum, methods, form of
financing, etc. The power of the State over private schools, through its
power to certify or not to certify for vouchers, will be even greater
than it is now.^[18](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn18)^

Since the Oregon case, the public school advocates have never gone so
far as to abolish private schools, but these schools remain regulated
and confined in numerous ways. Each state, for example, provides that
every child must be educated in schools it certifies, which again
coerces the schools into a curricular mould desired by the government.
In order to “qualify” as certified private schools, all sorts of
pointless and costly regulations have to be fulfilled, by the school as
well as by the teacher, who must often take a host of meaningless
“education” courses in order to be deemed qualified to teach. Many fine
private schools are now operating technically “illegally,” because they
refuse to conform to the often stultifying government requirements.
Perhaps the gravest injustice is that, in most states, parents are
prohibited from teaching their children themselves, since the state will
not agree that they constitute a proper “school.” There are a vast
number of parents who are more than qualified to teach their children
themselves, particularly the elementary grades. Furthermore, they are
more qualified than any outside party to judge the abilities and the
required pacing of each child, and to gear education to the individual
needs and abilities of each child. No formal school, confined to uniform
classrooms, can perform that sort of service.

“Free” schools, whether current public schools or future vouchered
schools, are of course not *really* free; someone, that is, the
taxpayers, must pay for the educational services involved. But with
service severed from payment, there tends to be an oversupply of
children into the schools (apart from the compulsory attendance laws
which have the same effect), and a lack of interest by the child in the
educational service for which his family does not have to pay. As a
result, a large number of children unsuitable for or uninterested in
school who would be better off either at home or working, are dragooned
into going to school and into staying there far longer than they should.
The resulting mania for mass schooling has led to a mass of discontented
and imprisoned children along with the general view that everyone *has*
to finish high school (or even college) to be worthy of being employed.
Adding to this pressure has been the hysterical growth of “antidropout”
propaganda in the mass media. Part of this development is the fault of
business, for employers are quite happy to have their labor force
trained, not by the employers or on the job, but at the expense of the
hapless taxpayer. How much of the burgeoning of mass public schooling is
a means by which employers foist the cost of training their workers upon
the taxpayers at large?

One would expect that this training, being without cost to employers,
will be highly expensive, inefficient, and far too lengthy. There is in
fact increasing evidence that a vast amount of current schooling is not
needed for productive employment. As Arthur Stinchcombe asks:

> Is there anything that a high school can teach which employers of
> manual labor would be willing to pay for, if it were learned well? In
> general, the answer is no. Neither physical abilities nor reliability,
> the two main variables of interest in employers of manual labor, are

> discipline. Otherwise they can train workers better and cheaper than a
> high school can, on the job.^[19](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn19)^

And, as Professor Banfield points out, most job skills are learned on
the job anyway.^[20](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn20)^

The relative uselessness of the public school system for training manual
labor is demonstrated by the fascinating work of MIND, a private
educational service now operated by the Corn Products Refining Company
of Greenwich, Connecticut. MIND deliberately chose high-school dropouts
who were unskilled for manual jobs, and in a few short weeks, using
intensive training and teaching machines, was able to teach these
dropouts basic skills and typing, and place them in corporate jobs. Ten
years of public schooling had taught these youngsters less than a few
weeks of private, job-oriented training! Allowing youngsters to drop out
from enforced dependency into becoming independent and self-supporting
could only have immeasurable benefits for the youngsters themselves and
for the rest of society.

There is considerable evidence linking compulsory attendance laws with
the growing problem of juvenile delinquency, particularly in frustrated
older children. Thus, Stinchcombe found that rebellious and delinquent
behavior is “largely a reaction to the school itself”; and the British
Crowther Committee found that when in 1947 the minimum school-leaving
age was raised by the government from fourteen to fifteen, there was an
immediate and sharp increase in the delinquencies committed by the newly
incarcerated fourteen-year-olds.^[21](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn21)^

Part of the blame for compulsory attendance and mass public schooling
must also be laid at the door of the labor unions which, in order to
reduce competition from young, adolescent workers, try to force the
youth out of the labor market and into educational institutions for as
long a time as possible. Thus, both labor unions and employers exert
powerful pressure for compulsory schooling and therefore for the
nonemployment of most of the nation’s youth.

## HIGHER EDUCATION [higher-education]

With the exception of the effects of compulsory attendance laws, the
same strictures we have levelled against public schools can also be
directed against public higher education, with one noteworthy addition.
There is increasing evidence that, certainly in the case of public
higher education, the coerced subsidy is largely in the direction of
forcing poorer citizens to subsidize the education of the wealthier!
There are three basic reasons: the tax structure for schools is *not*
particularly “progressive,” i.e., does not tax the wealthier in greater
proportion; the kids going to college generally have wealthier parents
than the kids who do not; and the kids going to college will, as a
result, acquire a higher lifetime working income than those who do not
go. Hence a net redistribution of income from the poorer to the richer
via the public college! Where is the ethical justification here?

Professors Weisbrod and Hansen have already demonstrated this
redistribution effect in their studies of public higher education in
Wisconsin and California. They found, for example, that the average
family income of Wisconsinites without children in Wisconsin state
universities was \$6,500 in 1964–1965, while the average family income
of families *with* children at the University of Wisconsin was \$9,700.
In California the respective figures were \$7,900 and \$12,000, and the
subsidy disparity was even greater because the tax structure was much
less “progressive” in the latter state. Douglas Windham found a similar
redistribution effect from poorer to wealthier in the state of Florida.
Hansen and Weisbrod concluded, from their California study:

> on the whole, the effect of these subsidies is to promote greater
> rather than less inequality among people of various social and
> economic backgrounds by making available substantial subsidies that
> lower income families are either not eligible for or cannot make use
> of because of other conditions and constraints associated with their
> income position.
>
> What we have found true in California—an exceedingly unequal
> distribution of subsidies provided through public higher
> education—quite probably is even more true for other states. No state
> has such an extensive system of local Junior Colleges as does
> California, and for this reason, no state has such a large percentage
> of its high school graduates going on to public higher education. As a
> result we can be rather confident that California has a smaller
> percentage of its young people receiving a zero subsidy than do other
> states.^[22](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn22)^

Furthermore, the states, in addition to putting private colleges into
financial jeopardy by their unfair, tax-subsidized competition, enforce
strict controls on private higher education through various regulations.
Thus, in New York State, no one can establish any institution called a
“college” or “university” unless he posts a \$500,000 bond with the
state of New York. Clearly, this severely discriminates against small,
poorer educational institutions, and effectively keeps them out of
higher education. Also, the regional associations of colleges, through
their power of “accreditation,” can effectively put *any* college that
does not conform to Establishment canons of curriculum or financing out
of business. For example, these associations strictly refuse to accredit
any college, no matter how excellent its instruction, that is
proprietary or profit making, rather than trustee-governed. Since
proprietary colleges, having a far greater incentive to be efficient and
to serve the consumer, will tend to be more successful financially, this
discrimination places another heavy economic burden on private higher
education. In recent years, the successful Marjorie Webster Junior
College in Washington, D.C., was almost put out of business by the
refusal of its regional association to grant it accreditation. While one
might say that the regional associations are private and not public,
they work hand in hand with the federal government, which, for example,
refuses to provide the usual scholarships or GI benefits to unaccredited
colleges.^[23](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn23)^

Governmental discrimination against proprietary colleges (and other
institutions, as well) does not stop at accreditation and scholarships.
The entire income tax structure discriminates against them even more
severely. By exempting trustee-run organizations from income taxes and
by levying heavy taxes on profit-making institutions, the federal and
state governments cripple and repress what could be the most efficient
and solvent form of private education. The libertarian solution to this
inequity, of course, is *not* to place equal burdens on the trustee
colleges, but to remove the tax burdens on the proprietary schools. The
libertarian ethic is not to impose equal slavery on everyone, but to
arrive at equal freedom.

Trustee governance is, in general, a poor way to run any institution. In
the first place, in contrast to profit-making firms, partnerships, or
corporations, the trustee-run firm is not fully owned by *anyone.* The
trustees *cannot* make profits from successful operation of the
organization, so there is no incentive to be efficient, or to serve the
firm’s customers properly. As long as the college or other organization
does not suffer excessive deficits it can peg along at a low level of
performance. Since the trustees cannot make profits by bettering their
service to customers, they tend to be lax in their operations.
Furthermore, they are hobbled in financial efficiency by the terms of
their charters; for example, the trustees of a college are forbidden
from saving their institution by converting part of the campus into a
commercial enterprise—say a profit-making parking lot.

The short-changing of the customers is aggravated in the case of current
trustee-colleges, where the students pay only a small fraction of the
cost of their education, the major part being financed by subsidy or
endowment. The usual market situation, where the producers sell the
product and the consumers pay the full amount, is gone, and the
disjunction between service and payment leads to an unsatisfactory state
of affairs for everyone. The consumers, for example, feel that the
managers are calling the tune. In contrast, as one libertarian remarked
at the height of the student riots of the late 1960s, “nobody sits in at
Berlitz.” Furthermore, the fact that the “consumers” are really the
governments, foundations, or alumni who pay the largest share of the
bill, means that higher education inevitably gets skewed in the
direction of their demands rather than toward the education of students.
As Professors Buchanan and Devletoglou state:

> The interposition of the government between the universities and their
> student-consumers has created a situation in which universities cannot
> meet demand and tap directly resources for satisfying student-consumer
> preferences. In order to get resources, universities have to compete
> with other tax-financed activities (armed forces, lower schools,
> welfare programs, and so forth). In the process, student-consumer
> demand is neglected, and the resulting student unrest provides the
> ingredients for the chaos we observe. ... The mounting dependence on
> governmental financial support, as this has been translated into the
> institution of free tuition, may itself be one significant source of
> current unrest.^[24](#24-notes.html#chap07_fn24)^

The libertarian prescription for our educational mess can, then, be
summed up simply: Get the government out of the educational process. The
government has attempted to indoctrinate and mould the nation’s youth
through the public school system, and to mould the future leaders
through State operation and control of higher education. Abolition of
compulsory attendance laws would end the schools’ role as prison
custodians of the nation’s youth, and would free all those better off
outside the schools for independence and for productive work. The
abolition of the public schools would end the crippling property tax
burden and provide a vast range of education to satisfy all the freely
exercised needs and demands of our diverse and varied population. The
abolition of government schooling would end the unjust coerced subsidy
granted to large families, and, often, toward the upper classes and
against the poor. The miasma of government, of moulding the youth of
America in the direction desired by the State, would be replaced by
freely chosen and voluntary actions—in short, by a genuine and truly
free education, both in and out of formal schools.
